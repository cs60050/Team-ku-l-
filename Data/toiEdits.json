A solution, therefore, must focus on changing agricultural practices. Indian agriculture is inefficient in its use of water. We use two to four times more water to produce a unit of major food crop than China or Brazil. Within India, a Punjab or a Maharashtra which are among the most water intensive producers of rice and sugar are key producer states. To get away from this suboptimal situation, governments must realise that power subsidies have had an adverse impact on irrigation patterns. States must break the groundwater-energy nexus to remove a perverse incentive to overuse groundwater.", "Decades of perverse incentives have led to a situation where 65% of the wells in India registered a decline when water level this year was compared with the last decade\u2019s average. Action on power subsidies needs to be complemented with use of technology to carry out aquifer mapping. Efforts thus far have been haphazard and technology needs to be used more effectively. Technology and tighter regulations also need to be combined to mitigate water contamination.

Although Suu Kyi herself is constitutionally barred from becoming president because her children have foreign citizenship, the new government plans to create a special post of \u2018state adviser\u2019 for her. In fact, Suu Kyi has said that she will be above the president and have de facto executive authority.", "While Suu Kyi\u2019s elevation to power is a culmination of her long struggle for democracy in Myanmar and a reflection of popular will, a system of dual power centres within the new dispensation can pose serious governance challenges. Add to this the fact that despite outgoing president Thein Sein\u2019s democratic reforms under a hybrid civil-military regime over the last few years, Myanmar\u2019s military still retains a substantial political role. A quarter of the seats in parliament are reserved for the army and the latter will appoint its own nominees for defence, home, and border affairs ministries. This shows that Myanmar\u2019s transition to democracy continues to be work in progress.", "In this context, Myanmar must avoid going down the Pakistan route with multiple power centres and an overbearing army, on pain of continued political instability. The Pakistan analogy also extends to Myanmar\u2019s domestic security situation which for decades has been plagued by multiple ethnic insurgencies. Only by ensuring full democratic rights to all Burmese groups, including the marginalised Rohingyas, and complete authority of the civilian leadership can Myanmar overcome its domestic challenges. That said, Myanmar today has transformed significantly. Foreign investments are pouring in, its economic growth has been hovering around the 8% mark, and the country is in the midst of a telecom revolution.", "To its credit India has maintained steady links with Myanmar throughout its democratic transition period. As a result, India today is in a good position to leverage historical and cultural links for mutual development. Add to this Myanmar\u2019s wariness about overdependence on China, and scope for New Delhi-Naypyidaw cooperation increases further. Besides, bilateral security cooperation against insurgencies and connectivity projects such as the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway are crucial for actualising India\u2019s Act East policy and galvanising its northeast.

Of the total of 46,923 cases registered all over the country in that year, 14,483 cases (over 30%) were from Punjab alone.

It is sandwiched between a marginally-higher Maharashtra (14,622 cases) and a significantly-lower Uttar Pradesh (5,742 cases).

Of the top 15 districts by cases registered, 13 were from Punjab, with Mumbai (Maharashtra) and Ernakulam (Kerala) being the other two. (Mumbai district, with 14,314 cases, is clearly an outlier amongst Indian districts, for various complex reasons not gone into here.) The remaining 7 out of 20 Punjab districts come within the top 40 districts by cases registered. The large spread of cases across the state of Punjab reveals the true extent of the problem: vulnerability to drugs is not restricted to just one or two cities in Punjab; it is a truth that is universal.", "The manner in which the NDPS Act is enforced in Punjab is ill-suited to the state, because the law focuses mainly on deterrence and prevention of trafficking.

Punjab shares a 553 km border with Pakistan, through which heroin is apparently channelled from Afghanistan. But the porous border is a small part of the problem. As one moves further inland, the pattern of drug use changes, but the incidence of drug use remains dangerously high. Police recovered massive quantities of opium (3,822 kg) and poppy husk (4,610 kg) in 2015 from Jalandhar and Ludhiana, respectively. No other state along the same Indo-Pak border boasts of the same magnitude of drugs-related cases.", "In 2013 and 2014, when the extent of drug abuse in the state first caught the attention of the national media, a social worker at a de-addiction centre in Punjab told us that the police went on an overdrive to appear to be taking steps to curb trafficking and actively rehabilitate addicts. Apparently, they forcibly took people enrolled for de-addiction, and sent them to rehabilitation camps set up by the government. This move corresponded with a fall in the number of arrests under the NDPS Act between 2014 and 2015.", "Burying the problem in the sand is not going to help anyone. A state government focussed only on saving face will be satisfied with knee-jerk reactions, without delving into the true cause of the problem.

Hikes in the US accompanied by cuts in India will cause capital to flee India.", "Citing a one-time fall in consumer price inflation to 3.8% in July does not make much sense as it has been facilitated both by a favourable base effect and ebbing food prices after the initial good rains. But RBI projections indicate that the softening trend is expected to continue only till August after which price rise will bounce back closer to 6% by January as household inflation expectations have returned to double digits.", "In any case a cut is unlikely to help investments much, as the banks are not likely to pass on the benefits to borrowers because the government has already pegged up the small saving rate in March even as RBI changed over to a pro-growth policy stance.

Developed countries have a historical responsibility to vacate carbon space and help developing countries like India meet emission mitigation targets without compromising on their development needs.

At the same time, Deaton has been open to taking strong stands be it on the efficacy of cash transfers or the possibility of long-term harm to recipients of foreign aid.

A solution would be to have a robust, autonomous body of writers that is willing to speak out on assaults on freedom of expression, no matter what quarter the attack is coming from.

This is ultimately detrimental to the interests of the ruling party, since it will be unable to deliver and the electorate may not vote for it next time. Of course, anger has some uses in politics. And neither is it confined to BJP. Arvind Kejriwal raged against the establishment to great effect, but this is yielding diminishing returns now. Rahul Gandhi tearing up a UPA ordinance looked entirely unconvincing. Belligerence from the prime minister, too, will yield diminishing returns.", "BJP would do well to realise that many voters prefer positivity and progress, and that while its culture wars and cow defence programmes may rally the base, they also alienate the mainstream.

Amaravati\u2019s creation is also being assisted by Singapore and Japan governments. The aim is to build a city benchmarked against the most liveable cities globally. Parks and open spaces get the largest share in the land use plan and a mass rapid transport system has been given priority too. A welcome feature has been the state government\u2019s attempt to build an emotional bond between citizens and Amaravati through crowd-funding and other measures.", "Projects on this scale usually get stuck in land acquisition problems. Andhra has beaten this hurdle by getting farmers to transfer 33,000 acres in barely a year through a land pooling approach. While this first hurdle has been cleared, more challenges lie ahead. Over Rs 1 trillion is needed for the city\u2019s infrastructure, which cannot come from the financially stretched state government. PPP, which will be an important resource raising mechanism, has a patchy record in India. Also, opposition parties are unhappy with the project, making Amaravati overdependent on Naidu.", "If this dream is to be realised, both the government and opposition must bridge their differences. Amaravati belongs to the state and everyone has a stake in it. NDA government must strongly support the state through the early phases of this project. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recognises urbanisation as an opportunity. He should walk the talk by backing Andhra Pradesh when it tackles the challenges which lie ahead \u2014 as Amaravati could provide an exciting template for building new cities across India."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

In the first half, until around 2002, he was breathtaking. The sheer audacity of stroke play against the best team in the world, Australia, was the stuff of legends. Subsequently, he seemed to transform into a mere run accumulator just when the Indian team had players to compete in all conditions. Sachin\u2019s overall impact, therefore, was below potential.", "He is not the only Indian batsman to have disappointed, but Sachin\u2019s case is most frustrating. As a 16-year-old, he displayed extraordinary courage in a hostile cauldron in Sialkot, Pakistan, to bat on despite a bloody nose as the match hung in the balance. Two years on, he hit a century at Perth when not one of his more established teammates could score a 50 in two innings. And in the decade between 1993 and 2002 he averaged over 60 in test cricket with his best performances reserved for the toughest opponents.", "To then watch Sachin downshift was disappointing.

Although books have been banned in India before, the ban on the import of The Satanic Verses became a definitive statement of the country\u2019s discomfort with opinions that \u201churt\u201d the sentiments of a community in real or perceived ways. Indeed, in a sense, the state response to Rushdie\u2019s controversial book was a precursor to the many bans and outrages that have followed since. M F Husain was assailed with lawsuits because some groups claimed he had painted Hindu goddesses in an obscene way. Hounded for years, India\u2019s most famous painter finally left the country and died abroad.", "The point is that bans fuel more bans. Each time the state clamps down on diversity of opinion, it provokes demands for more clampdowns. Needless to say, one cannot blame today\u2019s ban culture \u2013 which proscribes films, documentaries, books, dietary habits and so on at the drop of a hurt sentiment \u2013 on the banning of The Satanic Verses.

This augurs well for the economy. The impact of this positive development, however will remain muted on account of two successive subpar southwest monsoons. Rural demand is weak, which limits the potential of an industrial recovery. Another worrisome development which has cast a shadow on industrial recovery is the poor state of the global economy. This, in turn, has led to a difficult year for exporters. Despite these problems, the big picture suggests things are improving. The economy grew 7.4% in the June-September quarter, a shade faster than growth recorded in the previous quarter. The highlight was a growth rate of 9.3% in manufacturing. Despite the impressive performance of manufacturers, RBI did not raise its GDP forecast for 2015-16. The central bank stuck to its projection of a growth rate of 7.4% for the year and warned there is a \u201cmild downside bias\u201d to this figure.

Expenditure data shows that as much as Rs 37,355 crore of the defence ministry\u2019s capital modernisation budget of Rs 93,675 crore remained unspent by the end of 2015. Failure to spend the money at a time when India is modernising its defence forces \u2013 with several major defence deals like the Rafale fighter, self-propelled howitzers and M777 artillery guns in the last stages of negotiation \u2013 shows the capital mess our defence planning and budgeting structures are in.", "There are two reasons for this mess. First, defence deals take a long time to negotiate and do not follow the budgeting cycle of the financial year.

While a focus on urban problems is welcome, it is worth asking whether government is only thinking of technocratic solutions to India\u2019s urban problems. Can provision of greater resources and better technology alone improve the state of India\u2019s urban governance? Can the Smart Cities plan succeed, if government does not fully appreciate the relevance of people\u2019s participation?", "There are at least two reasons for supporting popular participation in governance. First, democracy cannot be equated with voting alone; all over the democratic world, people\u2019s participation between elections is viewed as a vital ingredient of democracy. Second, when people participate in civic bodies articulating their concerns about water, electricity, sanitation, roads, education, health and so forth, government gets better information about citizen needs and citizens take ownership of urban problems.", "Periodic interaction between governments and their people has improved governmental performance worldwide. That is why \u2018participation\u2019 has become a mantra of development agencies and governments alike, including the Indian government, which, from the passage of the 74th Constitutional Amendment to urban policies such as JNNURM, has emphasised the need to involve citizens. But have the Centre and states actually found a way to provide urban citizens with meaningful ways to participate in governance?", "A recent survey of 4,000 residents conducted jointly by Brown University and Janaagraha (Bangalore) suggests that little has been accomplished. Overall, public engagement in Bangalore is remarkably limited beyond the voting booth. Though about three-quarters of those surveyed had voted in the most recent local, state and national elections, an abysmal 2.6% of the respondents had attended ward councils.", "More than two-thirds could not name their ward councillor, even as 80% knew who was in power at the state and national level. Citizen participation in Bangalore remains heavily weighted towards the national and state elections. Our hypothesis is that this will be true of other Indian cities as well.", "In Bangalore, many citizens had difficulty even identifying the agencies responsible for service delivery. Much of the problem had to do with the fact that the local government\u2019s operations are often opaque and confusing. People do not know where to go to solve problems. Even though almost all citizens, except the most affluent, complain of shoddy public service delivery, such as uncertain water supply and sanitation problems, very few actually seek redress from the responsible government agencies. And for those who do so, many rely on intermediaries or bribes to get the system to work. Our findings underscore just how distant government remains from citizens. Problems of urban governance will be greater if this distance is not reduced.", "These institutional failings also appear to be weakening the very idea of citizenship. When Bangaloreans were asked about what the two most important citizen responsibilities were, \u2018voting\u2019 (72%) and \u2018respecting the law\u2019 (71.8%) were at the top, far above \u2018treating other citizens as equals\u2019 (48%) and \u2018being involved in your community\u2019 (5.8%).", "In other words, Bangaloreans are much more likely to associate the idea of citizenship with its formal dimensions (voting and respecting the law) than with respect for, and solidarity with, fellow citizens. Such solidarity, which can propel citizens to work together to solve urban problems, cannot be developed unless there are greater avenues for participation at the local level. Elections alone will not do.", "Moreover, while municipal councillors have very limited powers, other representatives such as the MLAs are simply too distant to play a meaningful role at the community level. Institutions such as ward committees that were designed to give citizens an effective platform to participate in public life and to voice their views to the government are just not working in Bangalore.", "Yet international experience and some important cases in India show that institutional innovations at the local level can make governance much more effective. In Kerala, Panchayati reforms have not only allocated new responsibilities to local governments, but given them control over 35-40% of the state\u2019s developmental budgets and made it easier for citizens to influence spending on everything from housing for the poor to healthcare.", "Pune, an IT hub with a large student and floating population like Bangalore, introduced participatory budgeting in 2006. This year, the exercise saw around 6,000 suggestions from citizens, indicating substantial citizen interest in how to spend public resources and improve local governance.

There is a need to institutionalise such platforms in urban India more generally through policy.", "The significance of civic engagement in urban policy making has been recognised by the Nagara Raj Bill, or the \u2018Community Participation Law\u2019, which mandated the creation of Area Sabhas. But, of 21 Indian cities surveyed by Janaagraha, only Hyderabad had Area Sabhas in place (http://janaagraha.org/asics/images/Annual-Survey-of-Indias-City-Systems-2014.pdf). Recent efforts by the Delhi government to expedite work on the Swaraj Bill and growing interest in the Smart Cities mandate by all stakeholders provide us an opportunity to rethink how participation can be catalysed through policy reforms.", "Perhaps the most telling evidence of the importance of participation comes from the experience of the poor and less educated in Bangalore. We found that although participation rates overall are low, the poor who do participate get a better quality of life in terms of access to basic infrastructure and services than those who do not participate.

WTO\u2019s multilateral agenda is what works best for us. Recent regional agreements such as TransPacific Partnership have onerous conditions and do not suit India.

This is not surprising, considering the lingering impasse in the Doha Round negotiations at WTO.", "In November 2001, during the 4th MC at Doha, an ambitious new round of complex negotiations was launched, covering a wide range of subjects like agriculture, environment, industrial tariff, services, anti-dumping and subsidies. The last MC held in Bali was significant in that the first multilateral agreement since the creation of WTO was adopted in the shape of the Trade Facilitation Agreement.", "The other two notable decisions related to protection from WTO dispute action for public stockholding of food in developing countries and the development of a road map to conclude the Doha Round negotiations by 2017.", "A major factor for the delay in concluding the Doha Round has been the radically changed stance of the US since 2009, duly supported by other developed countries. Almost all the gateway issues to conclude the Round had been successfully negotiated by the US, EU and other major participants like China and India. However, the Obama administration took the stand that the \u201cworld had changed\u201d because of the rapid rise of emerging countries, thus necessitating the renegotiation of all the tentative agreements reached during the Bush administration.", "An important proviso to this stand was that emerging countries would have to pay significantly more than agreed upon earlier. Another view propounded forcefully by the developed countries was that WTO could not afford to ignore \u201c21st century issues\u201d like competition, investment, government procurement, energy security, labour, environment, global value chains, e-commerce and regulatory coherence. Taken together, these propositions clearly lead to a rejection of the Doha mandate and implicitly call for a fresh mandate to start another Round, comprising perhaps only the new \u201c21st century issues\u201d. This is akin to saying that i will play the game as long as it suits me, if it does not i will abandon it and start another game, with rules of my choosing.", "Given the wide divergence of views among countries, the outcome at the Nairobi MC is fraught with uncertainty. India, along with other developing countries, stands to lose significantly if the Doha Round were to be abandoned without addressing its core issues, including disciplining of agriculture subsidies and market access in goods and services. Providing market access in agriculture products, especially those which are underpriced because of a high level of subsidies prevalent in developed countries, will damage Indian agriculture further and deepen the distress of our farmers.", "Moreover, the conclusion of the high ambition TPP agreement and the prospects of quick conclusion of TTIP and TISA, all of which are being negotiated at the initiative of the US, outside WTO, pose a threat to the very relevance of WTO other than as a forum for dispute settlement. In its own interest and in the broader interest of the developing countries, India has to ensure that the Doha Mandate is not abandoned at Nairobi. Yet another danger in the current situation is that developing countries like India may be cajoled into accepting some \u201c21st century issues\u201d for negotiations, without clarity as to the negotiating mandate.", "India\u2019s stand at Nairobi has to be obviously based on what it perceives to be in its national interest. The western media may try to attack and demoralise India at Nairobi by calling it \u201cobstructionist\u201d. India need not be deterred by such motivated criticism.", "India and other developing countries attach great importance to WTO since they feel that it is designed to be a rule based system and therefore likely to be more responsive to their interests. They have, hence, the unenviable and daunting task of ensuring that the WTO system continues to remain equitable and responsive to their interests and aspirations.

Federalism defines the Group, in the sense that the inspiration comes from a civilisational Indian trait: Respect for individual autonomy and creativity, drawing deeply from the Indian philosophy of anekantwad, appreciation that truth is a land that can be approached from multiple paths.", "Long before India was a nation-state, it was a collection of independent kingdoms and many peoples with their unique languages, traditions and cuisines. However, a certain tolerance for one another existed because of the overarching cohesive force of a similar set of principles and beliefs. Therefore, a federal structure \u2013 along with a certain unity founded on respect of each other despite the many diversities \u2013 thrived even before the audacious experiment that is modern India was born. In a sense, then, federalism has long been a part of the value system of most Indians, so it should come as no surprise that The Times Group takes to it so readily. Hence, behind that remarkable statistic, that TOI, the world\u2019s largest English language newspaper, is now over 175 years old \u2013 is a really simple, but deeply Indian philosophy.", "Federalism in this Indian tradition is, therefore, a balance between two conflicting forces that always apply to any collective human endeavour \u2013 authority and liberty. Neither can exist on its own, both need to feed off each other, and they always challenge each other. Progress is a tug of war between authority and liberty. Federalism provides for the best solution to this conflict because, while there is an authority, the powers of that authority are limited by liberty, and those powers diminish as the collective grows.", "The Times Group\u2019s federalism is, then, ultimately a reflection of its deep faith in liberty. Any collective needs an authority to stay together, but all constituents need liberty and freedom of thought and action if they, and the collective, are to evolve and flourish. A federal structure allows evolutionary dynamism; it frees all constituents from unitary determinism, the defining attribute of a centralised structure.", "All of the above points to a basic underlying fact: Not only is there no central \u201cline\u201d or policy or indeed one single \u201ccontroller\u201d in The Times Group, but there is also a positive tendency towards \u201cdecontrol\u201d.", "To many in the media industry where ownership of media is towards an end or agenda, such a view is incomprehensible.

In fact, NBT is sometimes found to be running editorials with a headline that proudly proclaims \u201cTOI ke virudh\u201d! This can be unsettling for some, including editors of long experience who would otherwise claim they welcome opposite points of view; one TOIeditor, for instance, was profoundly upset that his view, as articulated on the TOI\u2019s Edit page, had been totally opposed by his counterpart in the columns of NBT and demanded the setting up of an \u201ceditorial board for the Group\u201d. He soon found another job.", "Similarly, Anna Hazare\u2019s social \u201cmovement\u201d took most of the English press and its readers by storm not so long ago.

In fact, Times Now\u2019s Arnab Goswami has been asked most indignantly several times on air by dumbfounded peaceniks from both sides of the border, how he can be allowed such a hard line of questioning on Pakistan, when the TOI happened to have been doing the opposite that very morning.", "The answer is simple \u2013 the two entities are completely different, indeed in separate companies, with independent teams who rarely talk to each other but flaunt their freedom to follow their own \u201cline\u201d as a rite of passage in their journalistic careers.", "There is no one \u201cHouse line\u201d here. There can never be.", "Diverse opinions, points of view often within the same newspaper:", "The pluralism and freedoms described above are not just limited to different newspapers and TV channels across The Times Group \u2013 but occur within the same newspaper itself in many different ways.", "For instance, the TOIoften ends up saying the opposite thing on its News and Edit/Opinion pages; this is aided by the fact that these two teams are not only separate, but also do not report in to the same editor.", "In fact, the various editions of TOI are encouraged to write their own editorials to reflect local concerns and aspirations; what\u2019s more, their positions may not always be in line with the \u201cview from New Delhi\u201d.", "The pluralism at play is best exemplified by the franchise model across TOI.", "Each edition of the TOI is often very different from another even as the overall look and feel remains similar. This is because each edition of TOI is a different franchise \u2013 albeit governed by a set of broad rules \u2013 in the same way as the Indian franchise of a foreign magazine like, say, Grazia, is different from its franchise in another country. As a result, each edition has a separate print line, with a different editor in charge. The task of the overall TOIeditor, then, is to ensure that the independence of each editor is maintained, and to manage the system where these franchises run smoothly.", "It is but obvious, then, that different resident editors are, for instance, at liberty to drop a story that is Page 1lead in a sister edition, and free to exercise their judgment on individual stories. Not only does this mean that a story of interest to Nagpur may not appear in Mumbai, but it would also mean that often, stories that one might read in South Mumbai or Bandra or Andheri, do not appear in even Navi Mumbai.", "This is systematised wherein the TOI editor asks, for instance, editions to split their evening news lists into three sections \u2013 National, State and Local \u2013 based on each bureau chief\u2019s judgment of the extent of relevance of a story. Obviously, there is an element of subjectivity inherent in any such sectionalisation. But the final decision on which \u201coutstation\u201d stories to use, rests with individual editions, based on their mental and physical distance from the edition where a story originates.", "The decentralised nature of TOI is underlined by the editor\u2019s observation in an internal note that even when he travels to editions outside Delhi and Mumbai, he consciously takes a backseat during the evening news meeting \u2013 as he does not trust himself to know for sure what Ahmedabad or Chennai or Bangalore or even Kolkata, should or should not play up on Page 1 or inside. \u201cIn Chennai, for instance, I\u2019m told the obsession with Pakistan is far less than in Delhi\u201d, he pointed out.", "Why do we say \u201cmental and physical distance\u201d? Some years ago, the company decided to distribute the Bangalore instead of the Mumbai edition of The Economic Times in Kochi \u2013 due to proximity. But readers in Kochi weren\u2019t happy. They said they related more to the Mumbai edition, and it didn\u2019t matter that Bangalore was the nearest large city in south India.", "All of this makes the editors\u2019 job of selecting stories that much more difficult. On any given day, even editions with relatively generous space are not able to use more than perhaps 10% of what the national network produces \u2013 because an overwhelming majority of stories are used only in the edition of origin, and nowhere else. There is nothing wrong with that \u2013 95% of the stories that even Pune or Nagpur produce, do not appear in Mumbai; similarly, most of the stories that Mangalore or Mysore or Hubli produce, do not make it into the Bangalore edition.", "Any insistence, then, on all editions carrying the same story with the same emphasis, would therefore mean trying to enforce a single line, and would go against all the precepts outlined above \u2013 of federalism and liberty \u2013 and would militate against the Group\u2019s dharma of plurality.", "A question that is often asked is, if there are scores of media units in The Times Group\u2019s federal structure, and if all of them have the freedom to differ with one another, then which of the Company\u2019s many units best embodies the \u201cTimes\u201d belief system?", "The answer is: All of them.", "This is only achieved because in terms of operational philosophy, The Times Group\u2019s many publications and divisions are free to do what they want, and the federal authority (the management) encourages diversity that is truly unparalleled across any media company in the world.", "The advantage this confers over a model that emphasises \u201ca House line\u201d or \u201cview\u201d is this: A federal media company structure allows all its publications to evolve, in different ways, with different views, approaches and at different paces, in response to different challenges and consumer needs. The Times structure allows units to react with speed and seize unexpected opportunities as they see fit. This makes the Group larger than the sum of its many parts.", "A centralised authority works on the principle that it knows best, that all constituent units must receive their wisdom from a single person or body, and that there is one view.

Also, Tejas, a high speed premium service train which is to run without subsidies. In the backdrop of a decline in originating passengers, these new trains can reverse the decline and must be on the tracks soon.

The benefits of a transition to direct transfer are twofold: price distortions in the economy will end and people will be liberated from local power brokers.", "Transition to direct transfer has been delayed for two reasons.

Their philosophy, which is worthy of emulation, is to choose the best possible team for each format.", "The Indian team is presently in the midst of a transformation. In this context, a dual captain format is almost inevitable. Dhoni leads the side in limited overs, which is probably where he has been most effective.

Choosing captains according to formats is a part of that process.", "India\u2019s resounding defeats in Bangladesh have raised misgivings about having dual captains for Test and ODI cricket. Such a split leadership creates serious problems for players and distracts them from the game. Players who have to rally round their captain will find it difficult to gain the confidence of two different personalities who have vastly dissimilar dispositions. Such a diarchy will give rise to factions and irrational decisions, causing a collapse of the teams.", "Our experience with dual authority has usually been disastrous. The working of the UPA government with powers divided between the PM and Congress president is one such example. Split legislative powers between two houses of Parliament is now causing problems for NDA. Similarly dual allegiance of sports associations like the IOA to national and international bodies has caused much friction.", "The same principle is applicable to cricket. Players look forward to having one leader they can owe their allegiance to. It is therefore advisable to opt for a single captain for both Test and ODI cricket, whoever it is. This is especially so because captains also have influence in picking coaches and other support staff who have to pull along and make up a coherent team to win matches.

It could have asked Tomar to step down till he was cleared of charges. Alternatively, given that AAP is a media savvy party, it could have taken a leaf out of President Obama\u2019s book. Obama simply put up a copy of his birth certificate on his website to kill conspiracy theories. Likewise, since AAP is claiming a frame-up by the Centre, all it needs to do is display a copy of Tomar\u2019s law degree on its website. It is reasonable to assume that is what AAP would have expected of any other party in power.", "Eyebrows, however, will also be raised over the timing of Tomar\u2019s sudden arrest, just when the Centre-state controversy over Delhi is peaking.

The fact that this poses serious risks to the surrogate is ignored. The impoverished, uneducated women who rent out their wombs for money are not told about the risks. Typically, the payment ranges between Rs 2 and Rs 3 lakh. But instances of their not getting the promised amount are fairly common too.", "This vicious exploitation of surrogates must stop. India is one of the few countries in the world that allows commercial surrogacy. Yet it has no law to oversee the practice. At present the industry is loosely governed by certain general guidelines from Indian Council of Medical Research. Strangely, a comprehensive Assisted Reproductive Technologies (Regulation) Bill has been hanging fire in Parliament since 2010. It provides a range of medical, legal and financial safeguards to women who act as surrogates. It also contains measures to regulate fertility clinics, sperm banks and indeed, the entire apparatus of assisted reproductive technology in the country.", "The bill needs to be passed forthwith. Surrogacy is a technological marvel that benefits not just would-be parents, but also thousands of poor women who see this as a legitimate way of earning a lump sum.

This suggests that Ayush has a growing market and should not be dismissed out of hand.", "Alternative forms of medicine are gaining in popularity across the world. This is underpinned by the growing costs and side effects that western allopathy, presided over by Big Pharma, tend to have. In countries like China, traditional and western medicine are practised alongside each other at every level of the healthcare system, with one complementing the other. True, traditional medicine lags behind in terms of standardisation and critical research. But that\u2019s precisely what the Ayush ministry is supposed to work on.", "Integrating alternative medicine in the healthcare system makes economic sense as allopathy treatment can be expensive for poor patients. India must leverage its vast knowledge reservoir of traditional medicine to not only boost domestic healthcare but also make Ayush a key component of its global soft power. Different medicines work for different people. Ayush increases medical choice and adds to holistic wellness options.", "The continued dominance of allopathy and the miniscule role of traditional medicines like ayurveda and homeopathy in the Indian health sector reiterates that these antiquated systems will never regain a significant role in national healthcare. Such systems fail any rigorous scientific scrutiny and continue to survive because of the lower costs of quack treatment. In fact, developed countries issue regular warnings against the large presence of heavy metals in many herbal medicines and their toxic impact on vital organs.", "The biggest danger of traditional medical systems is that they remain outside the purview of government regulations and there are hardly any checks on the quality of alternative medicines. Similarly there are no common standards as treatment protocol and ingredients in medicines vary across locations. No wonder that such traditional systems are fast losing ground even in rural areas, where they reigned supreme till a few decades back. That this is happening despite the poor quality of allopathic medical care available in villages says something about how useless alternative medicines and therapies are.", "Having a ministry devoted to Ayush is therefore a waste of resources when public health is so sorely underfunded in India.

Hitherto, Central Asian nations have dealt with terrorism with an iron fist. But the rise of groups such as ISIS necessitates greater security cooperation among all stakeholders.

A state utility which owns a distribution network, for example, will not have a monopoly on subsequent supply of electricity. Consumers can choose to receive electricity from any supplier and the distribution company will not be allowed to deny access.

States such as Madhya Pradesh offered a staggering set of examples of families rendered destitute by acquisition carried out for dams and irrigation projects.", "Aside from vaguely worded policies and state commitments little existed that could truly help victims\u2019 cause. The law would have to make amends for the wrongs done by its predecessor \u2014 the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 \u2014 across the country.", "Two thoughts supported this rationale: First, the public purpose for which land was being acquired would anyway have been rendered redundant by the passage of time (in many cases greater than a decade) leaving the ensuing acquisition unnecessary.", "Second, this was not just an academic or historic injustice that could be remedied by a simple restatement of principles. The sheer scale of loss to landowners who were victims of this acquisition was so immense, their numbers so large, that it could not be ignored. These people would derive little benefit from an ambitious new law that ignored the very reasons why it had even been enacted.", "Understandably, local authorities who carried out acquisitions with impunity are now worried.

The question they must be asked is this: is acquisition a tool to enrich state land banks?", "Even though the clause was a deeming provision which created a scenario in which all faulty acquisitions lapsed on the date of the law coming into force, few, if any, authorities actually implemented it. This prompted affected fami-lies to seek recourse from courts which interpreted it with equity.", "Giving life to the very sentiment with which Parliament enacted the law, the Supreme Court laid down landmark judgments returning the land to its original owners. The apex court even laid down parameters on the basis of which compensation would be considered to have been paid (it must be deposited in court and not just in the government treasury).", "The high courts too followed a similar path, with ground-breaking judgments by a bench of Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed and Justice S Mridul of Delhi high court. The Delhi judgments are significant because they clarified that acquiring authorities could not get away by claiming the land was under litigation and hence could not be acquired. Similar judgments were given by the Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Haryana and Karnataka high courts. Thousands of families suffering for decades suddenly found themselves libe-rated from the spectre of acquisition.", "Drafting a retrospective clause is always tricky. One has to ensure that the boundaries of language are set in a manner so that principles of natural justice are not violated. Another concern is ensuring that the greatest possible number of cases is covered. Given the volume of families that have invoked its benefits, we can argue the law to be an example of successful legislative intervention.", "Some critics of this clause (and consequently the law itself) argue that larger public interest is being subverted to benefit a small group of individuals. This is not true. It is for this very reason that the clause includes a moratorium of five years before the affected family qualifies for benefits envisaged therein.

Identity politics may still play an important role in Indian elections. But if BJP is able to perform well in both states without having a local heavy hitter, it would definitely mean that issues beyond identity are steadily gaining traction.", "A positive development of campaigning in both states has been that it has been relatively free of the kind of polarising approach that characterised UP bypolls.

How much longer should we rely on the resolve of one individual, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, to project an unyielding stance in the battle against inflation? It is time to institutionalise recent efforts by changes in laws or processes as durable success cannot be built around individuals.", "Recent developments in oil give government a chance to transition to market-based pricing of diesel immediately. Once this is done, it frees up a lot of budgetary space for government and also helps public sector oil exploration companies which have had to bear a part of the subsidy burden. Lower diesel prices also ease inflationary pressure on the economy. But the institutional response to fighting inflation needs a lot of reform, including legislative changes. RBI has done the spadework over the last year by gradually getting everyone accustomed to monetary policy that will be based on targets. This introduces accountability. However, this job is incomplete as the necessary legal changes as well as checks and balances on RBI are not yet in place.", "Government now needs to get cracking on these reforms. They will be the building blocks for its other goals such as \u2018Make in India\u2019. High rates of inflation will not encourage companies to start factories in India as it erodes our international competitiveness. If we reform our fuel subsidy regime and also install institutional mechanisms to fight inflation, there will be long-term benefits for the economy."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

This means that des-pite having among the richest coal reserves in the world, India is unable to produce coal of sufficient quantity or quality. It has led to a perverse situation of power plants without coal and perennial power shortages even as Coal India oppo-ses denationalisation.

Well, it happens that the rice crop in numerous areas of Punjab and Haryana are harvested about this time. The paddy is quickly delivered to FCI godowns. But paddy straw and ground stubble are a problem. Labour is too expensive in these states for ploughing the straw into the fields to enrich the soil; the local cattle (buffaloes) will not eat the straw of the particular rice varieties grown; and rice straw has too high a silica content for it to be safely burnt in biomass power generators.

For one, withdrawal of groundwater substantially exceeds annual recharge, with the result that the water table falls continuously each year.

Three corrections need to be effected in parallel. First, the MSP for rice needs to increase each year at a rate slower than that of general inflation.

More than the early 1950s, Indian politics is starting to resemble the late 1980s.", "In the first decade of Independence, Congress was all-conquering and all-pervasive. It ran governments in New Delhi and almost every state. By the 1980s, India had settled into a patchwork of nationally weak but geographically dispersed opposition parties. There were one-and-a-half national parties: Congress, and either one of the Janata incarnations (strong in northern and eastern India) or BJP (strong in northern and western India). In addition, there were robust regional parties, especially in the south.", "Today, BJP seems to have become the principal party in just such a polity. For the near future, it will face challenges from regional politicians and occasionally from Congress but will probably remain the single biggest all-India party.

Despite a three-and-a-half cornered contest, quite like Maharashtra, and despite the Modi buzz, BJP faces a tough competitor in Mayawati\u2019s BSP. The lady retains her dalit base, even if some of it migrated to Modi in the Lok Sabha election. That aside, she retains goodwill among urban voters and sections of upper caste voters whom BJP sees as its natural constituency. Her ability to rebuild the social coalition that put her in power in 2007 cannot be dismissed.", "Either way, Modi versus Mayawati would be a fascinating contest.

In the first, it can hope to get its best ever numbers and even be the single-largest party. However, it will probably have to share power with a party from the Valley. Will this lead to a rotational arrangement for the chief ministry, giving both Kashmir and Jammu and both a Muslim and a Hindu a chance to head the state government?", "What if the biggest party in the Valley is the People\u2019s Democratic Party?

In a sense, the battle for Srinagar is a fitting finale to 2014, the most audacious, path-breaking year in BJP\u2019s life.", "Punjab too points to the boundaries of going it alone. Despite the brave words of its more enthusiastic supporters, BJP cannot easily break ties with Akali Dal. The arrangement in this state is not just a political alliance but also a social alliance. In opposition or in government, it contributes to the stability of Punjab. BJP has to be mindful of this.", "Admittedly corruption is a pressing issue in Punjab. There is a fatigue with both the Akali-led state government and individual BJP MLAs and BJP-run municipal corporations.

The induction of Manohar Parikkar and Suresh Prabhu is an excellent move, signalling that Modi believes in rewarding competence and proven track records in administration and governance and is moving to address the relative lack of intellectual bench strength in the existing cabinet. That Harvard-educated Jayant Sinha has been inducted shows that the government is keenly aware that with the Union budget just five months away, Arun Jaitley will need as much support as he can get from reform-minded individuals.", "At the same time Modi has also made some compromises with electoral politics, distributing portfolios to those who are important for caste and regional reasons given the election schedule ahead.

The vision document for Asia-Pacific brings India\u2019s \u2018Act East\u2019 policy closer to the US pivot to Asia, and for that reason has riled the Chinese. But if the US stands up for a greater Indian role in the Asia Pacific, there\u2019s no reason to cavil.

While no monetary value can be placed on this, the figure should be at least Rs 10 lakh. A third component should be a punitive fine imposed on the agency that has been negligent.

In that sense, President Mukherjee has made a balanced intervention. Indians don\u2019t send their representatives to Parliament to watch them disrupt it. Unfortunately, this problem has intensified over the years. For instance, the last Lok Sabha functioned for just over half the sittings of the first one.", "The key question is why the government is unable to get legislation moving despite BJP being in the enviable position of enjoying an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha. Eternal parliamentary logjam will prevent India from realising its true potential and short-circuit the democratic process itself. The upcoming budget session is a crucial one; both ruling and opposition parties must heed the president\u2019s suggestion and sit together to find a way to avoid disruptions. The business of Parliament is important and must be taken seriously.

Instead of new permanent members, let us have a new category of members, serving a much longer term than the non-permanent ones, and eligible for immediate re-election.

From now on, let them \u2013 and the whole Council \u2014 give groups representing people in zones of conflict a real chance to inform and influence their decisions.", "And finally, let the Council, and especially its permanent members, make sure the UN gets the kind of leader it needs.

But whether Obamacare succeeds in curbing excessively high healthcare costs will depend on the Obama administration\u2019s other policies, particularly in an area that might seem unrelated: the US\u2019s ongoing discussions with India over intellectual property.", "Pharma costs account for an increasingly large component of US healthcare spending. Indeed, outlays for prescription drugs, as a share of GDP, have nearly tripled in just 20 years. Lowering healthcare costs thus requires greater competition in the pharma industry \u2013 and that means allowing the manufacture and distribution of generic drugs.", "Instead, the Obama administration is seeking a trade deal with India that would weaken competition from generics, thereby making lifesaving drugs unaffordable for billions of people \u2013 in India and elsewhere. This is not an unintended consequence of an otherwise well-intentioned policy; it is the explicit goal of US trade policy.", "Major multinational pharma companies have long been working to block competition from generics. But the multilateral approach, using WTO, has proved less effective than they hoped, so now they are attempting to achieve this goal through bilateral and regional agreements. Latest negotiations with India \u2013 the leading source of generic drugs for developing countries \u2013 are a key part of this strategy.", "In the 1970s India abolished pharma patents, creating an advanced and efficient generics industry capable of providing affordable medicines to people throughout the developing world.

The Indian government\u2019s desire to enhance its trade relations with the US thus provides this industry an ideal opportunity to pick up where TRIPS left off, by compelling India to make patents easier to obtain and to reduce the availability of low-cost generics.", "So far, the plan seems to be working. Last fall, during his visit to the US, Indian PM Narendra Modi agreed to establish a working group to re-evaluate the country\u2019s patent policy. US participants in this group will be led by the Office of the US Trade Representative, which serves the pharma companies\u2019 interests, rather than, say, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health.", "How might India tighten its patent system? For starters, it could lower its standards for what is considered a \u2018novel\u2019 product, and thus one that merits intellectual-property protection. As it stands, India sets the bar quite high, resulting in its refusal to grant patents for new combinations of existing drugs. India could also stop issuing compulsory licences to allow other companies to produce a patent holder\u2019s drug, in exchange for a fee \u2013 an arrangement permitted under TRIPS, but anathema to the drug industry.", "India\u2019s current policies allow drugs to be sold at a small fraction of the monopoly prices commanded by patent holders. For example, the Hepatitis-C drug Sovaldi is sold for $84,000 per treatment in the US; Indian manufacturers are able to sell the generic version profitably for less than $1,000 per treatment. This generic price is still a huge expense for people living on a few dollars a day; but, unlike the US price, it is manageable for many governments and aid organisations.", "This is hardly an isolated example. Low-cost generics have made it possible to treat tens of millions of HIV/AIDS patients in the developing world.", "In fact, the threat of competition from Indian generics is partly responsible for major pharma companies\u2019 decision to make some of their drugs available to the world\u2019s poor at low prices. If the US compels India to tighten its patent rules substantially, so that they resemble US rules more closely, this outcome could be jeopardised.", "Of course, if America\u2019s strong patent regime were, as its proponents claim, the best way to foster innovation in the pharma industry, the Obama administration\u2019s policy toward India could perhaps be justified.

A patent that raises the price of a drug a 100 fold has the same effect on the market as a 10,000% tariff. Furthermore, patent-supported research encourages secrecy as companies disclose only the information needed to acquire patents. Yet openness is crucial for efficient scientific progress.", "If the Obama administration succeeds in forcing India to strengthen its patent laws, the change would harm not only India and other developing countries; it would also enshrine a grossly corrupt and inefficient patent system in the US, in which companies increase their profits by driving out the competition \u2013 both at home and abroad.

To its great credit, it has brought back the spirit of volunteerism in Indian politics. However, idealism on its own is not enough for the long haul. It needs to be backed up by institutional structures to deal with ubiquitous challenges. For AAP, the challenge now is internal. It needs to figure out what kind of political force it wishes to be.", "One way to view AAP\u2019s ongoing inner turmoil is to frame it in the context of a power struggle between those who have chosen pragmatism as the party\u2019s touchstone and woolly-headed ideologues. AAP and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in their second stint in Delhi, have been more inclined to work with political opponents for the state\u2019s benefit. But that has become a source of friction within. Constitutional architecture makes it impossible for anyone to fly solo. A more durable problem might be that AAP is a grab bag of disparate ideas which makes internal strife inevitable.", "Kejriwal provided the party with the face it needed to persuade people to buy into its narrative.

Yadav has the outlook of a Lohiaite socialist ideologue while Bhushan has ridden left-wing hobby horses such as a plebiscite in Kashmir.

But the elephant has broken into a run and it\u2019s headed in the right direction.", "The Budget has a coherent framework which outlines NDA\u2019s overarching vision to spur economic growth and create a social safety net. The state, either directly or through its own companies, will play a lead role in increasing economic momentum and drawing in private investment. This is expected to get an additional boost in the form of legislative and other measures to ease the process of doing business. All of this will be supported by steps to ensure macroeconomic stability that comes through fiscal consolidation and financial sector reforms. The vision is welcome, though much will depend on the success government has with legislation.", "Consistent with the rail budget announced on Thursday, Jaitley acknowledged the existing PPP system of drawing in private investment in infrastructure is broken. He has tried to partially offset that with sizeable allocations to build new infrastructure for railways and roads. The key message in the Budget, however, is that the state will have to bear the major part of the risk of these projects so as to draw in private investment. It\u2019s a proactive approach as there seems no other immediate solution.", "Jaitley has promised this approach will not mean a return to profligate ways. Fiscal consolidation is on track even if targets have been moved back by a year. The fiscal deficit is expected to be at 3% of GDP in 2017-18. Along with this, India will get a sorely needed legal framework to keep inflation under control through a monetary policy framework agreement with RBI. In addition, the financial sector and public sector banks are both set for reforms. Without getting this right it will be difficult to generate resources to fund India\u2019s growth.", "Linked to financial sector reforms are rich possibilities opened up by a confluence of developments that allow all Indians to be brought into the formal banking system. Direct transfer of benefits is expected to be enhanced and will help the subsidy burden trend downwards. Even NDA\u2019s social security net is woven around the financial sector. Pension and insurance have been woven together for a universal social security net.", "The drive to raise resources to fund infrastructure has informed Jaitley\u2019s tax policy. Disappointingly, there are no real tax breaks for the middle class. All direct tax concessions are aimed at drawing in more money into long-term investment vehicles such as pension funds or health insurance. More money in the hands of middle class to consume can also trigger a virtuous cycle. More so, when Jaitley has resorted to enhancing service tax rates to raise resources, a step that will affect almost everyone.", "Jaitley\u2019s promise to clean up direct tax by simultaneously reducing corporate tax rates and closing their exemptions is the right step. A messy tax system helps no one. In this context, it makes sense to deal with the legacy of the Vodafone tax controversy more decisively to set foreign investors\u2019 anxieties at rest.", "On balance, the Budget has many positive features, of which clarity is the most important. It\u2019s not the big-bang Budget many were expecting. But judged by the standards of preceding budgets over the last decade or so, it\u2019s a solid one."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

And the Agenda for Alliance they have drafted after two months of deliberation takes a reasonable stab at workable compromises on the many differences between them.", "As if to underline contradictions that will have to be tackled, just hours into his new government Sayeed courted controversy by crediting Pakistan, Hurriyat and militants for \u2018allowing\u2019 peaceful assembly elections. This was perhaps a concession to a core constituency nettled by his closeness to BJP. But in working together the two parties should help smoothen out each other\u2019s rough edges over time, so that both gravitate towards governing from the centre rather than their respective poles. That also implies both parties must learn to address the state as a whole, not in parts. That\u2019s the only way they can improve governance in J&K. And each party has a stake in improving governance as their reputations depend on it.", "The new cabinet has 11 ministers from PDP, 6 from BJP and includes Sajjad Lone. This represents a welcome opening for other separatists to join the political mainstream. Perhaps this is also why when the opposition was attacking Sayeed for thanking Hurriyat and Pakistan, BJP remained restrained. Sitting in both central and state governments now, it cannot ignore the reality that there is no road to long-term peace except through parleys with separatists.

At the heart of the change is an attempt to bring discipline and accountability into RBI\u2019s fight against inflation. Very likely this will also influence the way the finance ministry functions and thereby enhance the quality of key institutions.", "FIT works by first quantifying a range within which inflation as measured by consumer price index will be contained: 2% to 6%. With a quantitative measure in place, RBI has to clearly outline the instruments which will be used to keep inflation in check. In the event it fails in its task to keep it in check, the central bank will have to explain to the government the reasons for failure and the time needed to succeed.", "FIT tries to strike a fine balance between bringing down inflation \u2013 which is a central bank\u2019s primary job \u2013 and being mindful of economic growth. This is a system that has stood the test of time and economic shocks both in developed markets such as the UK and an emerging market like South Africa, which moved to FIT almost 15 years ago. If India is to raise the standard of policy making, there has to be more accountability demanded of the finance ministry and its regulators. RBI is the right place to start the process. The legislative changes for FIT which will follow must ensure transparency to enforce accountability.

Not all reactions have been negative. The reinterpretation has been welcomed by Japan\u2019s most important ally, US.

The security pact provided US with the right to establish military bases in Japan, which were used for combat operations during the Vietnam War. Pacifism in a somewhat hostile neighbourhood does require some sacrifice and Japanese have had a troublesome time in dealing with US bases.

Given that his expectation from PPP investment this year has increased by merely Rs 5 crore to Rs 6,005 crore, he clearly faces a challenge ahead.", "Lax management has over years left railways with unfinished projects that require close to Rs 2 trillion. To this, add a potential white elephant like a Rs 60,000 crore bullet train and another salary revision in January 2016, and railways run the risk of remaining a drag on the economy rather than a force multiplier for it. Gowda, however, deserves credit for treating passengers with more respect than usual. Rail travel will hopefully become a less daunting experience with an emphasis on cleanliness and related amenities. Enhancing online booking facilities, a focus on safety of passengers and acknowledging the difficulty faced by differently abled is welcome. Another good aspect of the budget is that being mindful of passenger comfort is not limited to select amenities. Gowda\u2019s promise to review endless stoppages which increase duration of a journey was long overdue. Toying with the idea of a bullet train while other trains crawl makes no sense.", "Eventually, what will mark Gowda\u2019s stint as railway minister is the manner in which he transforms the organisation. Freight trains chugging along at an average speed of 25km per hour drag down the economy. Unless freight trains can pick up speed, India will be shackled when dealing with competing economies. The key will be to eventually get private players eager to invest in railway infrastructure.", "\u00a0"], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

About 53% of AIIMS graduates actually leave the country, most permanently, and you cannot really point a finger at them.", "There are three strikes against AIIMS as it stands today. First, it is overloaded; according to one estimate, about 7,000 sick people daily visit its OPDs. The marble counter across which patients register has become concave, as millions of elbows have rubbed on it for decades. On any day, rain or shine, there are hundreds lying in the open hoping for a look-in and a doctor\u2019s attention.", "Second, pay and working conditions are hardly of the kind that would enthuse doctors to spend long hours in the hospital giving their all. It takes five and a half years for the basic MBBS degree \u2014 to be a specialist, even longer. After all that, if you are a professor and top of the heap in AIIMS, you can hope to earn a basic salary of Rs 51,600 a month. This does not even compare with the corporate sector where an ordinary hand could get three times this amount in a tenure that is three times less.", "So a bright young person who signs up to be a doctor is looking at many years of hard work and little material compensation at the end of it. Naturally, the exodus of doctors to America (about 70% of brain drainees) and to private hospitals is growing rapidly in the country. Therefore, if we have just one qualified MBBS for 1,700 people \u2014 and not 1,100, the minimum WHO standard \u2014 should we be surprised?", "This figure is in line with the huge number of vacancies, in the hundreds, in AIIMS today. This sorry statement is compounded by the fact that only in 2013, after a gap of a decade, the UPSC sent out a call for doctors. And then there is this spoofy bit: the Rajiv Gandhi and the Janakpuri super speciality hospitals, both in the heart of the capital, only offer OPD services. In fact, TOI reports that at the Janakpuri hospital not a single super specialist has been hired so far.", "With genes like these, is it really worth multiplying them all over the country? There should be a certain eugenics for hospitals or else we\u2019ll repeat the same rotten strain many times over.

On top of that there are all those hours of research that are par for the course; anything less than that will not do. Even Mao Zedong, at the height of his powers, had to pull back barefoot doctors in China. Sure, physicians should dedicate their services to the sick and needy, but they too require professional sustenance, and not all of them are greedy.", "By 2020, India needs roughly four lakh more doctors and the number of primary health centres must double to about 50,000. It is this tearing hurry that allowed the Ketan Desai-led Medical Council of India to recognise 35 medical colleges that should never have made the grade. Trade quantity for quality and medical care takes a deep dive, even in the short run.", "Without a doubt, AIIMS should act as an exemplar, but its muscles need toning. Only then will its lookalikes reflect what medical standards are all about. This is why AIIMS must return to its glory days when it represented cutting-edge healthcare. True, there are still many doctors in here who can hold a candle to the best in the world. But such people are near saints, and getting rare, because miracles don\u2019t come easy.

With the fighting having already claimed 341 Palestinian lives and maimed thousands more, further escalation of the conflict must be contained.", "The Palestine cause is an emotive issue in Indian political circles. With a discussion on Palestine scheduled in Parliament today, some MPs may indulge in high-pitched rhetoric. The government would do well to vociferously condemn the violence in Parliament and privately tell Israel to agree to a ceasefire. A bigger challenge, however, looms with President Obama mounting pressure on Moscow to permit an impartial international investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine. This has been accompanied by mounting outrage in Europe, as indications are that the plane was brought down by separatists aided by heavy weapons from Moscow, including the Buk missile system capable of knocking out high-flying aircraft.", "This suspicion will deepen if the separatists impede an impartial probe of the crash which happened on territory held by them. That could open the way to a Russia-West confrontation. Should Europe back US on tough sanctions against Russia then India, too, could be asked to participate in the isolation of Russia. That would be tricky given Russia\u2019s consistent support for India at the UN Security Council.

By the mid-1960s a Free Trade Zone in Kandla, Gujarat, was functional. As the concept evolved over time we moved to creating a legal framework for SEZs about a decade ago. But the record of SEZs has hardly been impressive. It`s unlikely that another round of incentives and tax benefits for tiny enclaves, in the hope they would eventually have a positive impact on the rest of country, will work. Instead, the emphasis should be on improving the general economic environment across the country.", "SEZs are supposed to be characterised by minimum bureaucracy, tax incentives and superior infrastructure. The aim is to create a bubble in which firms would operate in conditions similar to developed countries. If, however, we did this only for a few selected enclaves, industry is likely to migrate here from the rest of the country. This could have a net negative effect for India as inequality within the country is exacerbated. That has actually happened in China, which has moved from the radical egalitarianism of the Mao years to a situation where it is more unequal than India, giving rise to social tensions.", "CAG says government has not carried out necessary analysis to measure the impact of existing concessions to SEZs. Moreover, finance minister Arun Jaitley does not seem enthusiastic about tax breaks for SEZs. Following the budget, he told Parliament that he saw no justification in excluding SEZ developers and units from Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT). Instead of hoping for trickle-downs from enclaves, NDA government should focus on improving the economic environment across the country. Minimum bureaucracy, a stable and transparent tax regime and better infrastructure are a national need.", "The move to kick off a debate and implement special laws in SEZs is overdue. Though SEZs have made substantial progress \u2014 with total investments, exports and employment shooting up \u2014 they are still a long way from achieving full potential. Slowdown in global trade, uncertainties in tax policies and liberal enhancement of export incentives in non-SEZ areas have hurt the prospects of the sector. As things stand, there`s nothing \u201cspecial\u201d about SEZs any more. This needs to change.", "Almost two thirds of SEZ exports are from IT and petroleum sectors. Manufacturing continues to be an Achilles heel. So only a substantial re-haul of the regulatory regime, including labour laws, can breathe new life into SEZs. A serious drawback is that labour laws are outside the purview of section 49 of the SEZ Act, which makes states unable to modify laws to suit exporter needs. Export markets being erratic, firms require greater flexibility in use of labour and this can only be done through changes in SEZ law.", "As far as reforms in labour law and other reforms are concerned, SEZs can serve as a good laboratory as it`s politically difficult to push reforms in India. A successful outcome from the liberalisation of rules in SEZs will provide a major fillip to the extension of reforms to the rest of the country, once it`s palpably demonstrated that they work. The argument that separate rules for SEZs serve no purpose and that it is time to roll out a flexible labour regime for all manufacturing activity nationally is unrealistic. It`s impossible to roll out great infrastructure all over the country at once. Among other things, this will require funds on a scale India won`t be able to mobilise.

Research in manipulating memory, on this occasion by neuroscientists at MIT, is an important part of medical research.

Manipulating it is an effective way of transforming lives.", "For sure, there is an ethical dimension to manipulating memory. A question that sometimes comes up is whether this is a case of trying to play god. It happens to be an issue that can never be resolved. What is undeniable is that memory lies at the heart of serious psychiatric disorder. The immediate priority should be to treat it in the most effective way. If manipulating memory is the answer, a humane society should not hesitate to use it. Metaphysical quests should not become an excuse for inaction.", "There is nothing sacrosanct about memory. Altering it through some kind of intervention is an acceptable way to better one\u2019s life. As in the case of some other interventions, ethical questions are bound to rise and they should as it serves as an inherent system of checks and balances to the direction of scientific research.

Neuroscientists working on this idea say it will help people cope with traumatic experiences. This sounds tempting, because every adult has memories that make her heart ache. Yet, all the pain and the damage helps make us what we are. It hurts. It also teaches, strengthens, stops us making the same mistakes all over again, and helps us meet joy.

All India Bar Association chairman Adish C Aggarwala rightly argues that such a move would be ill advised and unethical.

Those were very strong words, justified only by what\u2019s at stake. Separation of powers remains as much a mainstay of Indian democracy, so BJP\u2019s position on it must remain constant too.

It is the government\u2019s prerogative to designate a governor.

Retired chief justice of J&K high court S S Kang has been governor of Kerala.

Let\u2019s be clear on a few things. \u201cGood people\u201d give for the joy of giving because it makes them feel good about giving, and hence joy is their reward. \u201cGood people\u201d are also good to themselves, which means that if there is anything about the giving that causes pain to themselves, they value themselves enough to say, \u201cI choose to give\u00a0 but not at the cost of feeling burdened or unhappy\u201d, because that\u2019s not giving, that\u2019s an expectation or job or role that I\u2019m now resenting. Most importantly, when it comes to reciprocity, you have to recognise the importance of it. In metaphysics we have a concept called \u201cenergy exchange\u201d.\u00a0 When you give money you get a product or service, similarly in energy exchange we must give back to those that give to us and vice versa. If you are moving mountains for those that selfishly neither fully appreciate nor help make your life easier, perhaps you need to question your pattern and change it. It\u2019s senseless and stupid to pour all your energy into a black hole.", "\nRespect is crucial in relationships, be it personal or professional.

In recognition of her own principle that diplomacy should consist of commas and not full stops, Swaraj should take the logical next step of throwing Aksai Chin into the one-China mix as well, in return for Chinese recognition of Arunachal Pradesh as part of India.

Another area of cooperation is counterterrorism. While India offers a huge and growing market for China, Pakistan is sinking under the tide of jihadi terror and political instability.

Half-baked subsidy reforms have meant that as the differential between price of kerosene and diesel widened over the years, an increasing proportion of subsidised kerosene has been diverted to adulterate other fuels.

By introducing plea bargaining in terror cases \u2014 wherein a probable death sentence could be reduced to life imprisonment \u2014 investigations can be expedited and justice delivered.", "Plea bargaining in terror cases significantly reduces the time to investigate a particular terror lead. There\u2019s no denying that time is of the essence when it comes to cracking a terror plot. The longer it takes to investigate a detained terror suspect, the easier it is for terror groups to change their plans and tactics. In fact, plea bargaining incentivises detained terror suspects to cooperate with investigators. They have a 50% chance of being convicted of a higher charge if they keep quiet. But plea bargaining gives them a guarantee of a lower charge or sentencing if they cooperate. Many undertrials would take that deal if offered. This would also save significant resources for investigative agencies such as NIA and greatly reduce their backlog of cases.", "Of course, plea bargaining doesn\u2019t infringe upon the right of the accused to continue to plead his innocence. In this regard, the argument that plea bargaining will be used by prosecutors to extract false confessions is specious. Such bargains are anyway subject to the ultimate discretion and wisdom of judges who can reject them. If countries such as the US, Canada and England can allow the common use of plea bargaining as a legal tool, there\u2019s no reason why India shouldn\u2019t. Terror investigations will certainly get a boost via plea bargaining.", "David Headley, a Pakistani-American who played a role in preparing the ground for the November 2008 terror attack in Mumbai, successfully plea bargained in the US to avoid the likelihood of capital punishment or extradition to India. It was a frustrating moment for Indian authorities, which should today make them think harder on wanting to expand the scope of plea bargains here to cover terror cases. If one thinks it through, there are compelling reasons to avoid plea bargains at this point in time in terror cases.", "Plea bargains work best when the justice system is robust. Evidence in India suggests otherwise. In this situation, plea bargains may lead to an unacceptably high collateral damage in terms of creating a system which forces innocents into false confessions. For instance, terror strikes in India have often been followed by sweeping arrests which, years later, have led to just the odd conviction. In the interim, families of those arrested have been subject to severe economic and social consequences on account of the stigma. It is in this context that plea bargains are dangerous. Combine the state\u2019s weak investigative capabilities with the collateral damage to families of those arrested, then plea bargains may induce false \u2018quasi-confessions\u2019 as innocents seek to protect their families. This situation removes any incentive for investigative agencies to improve their standards as plea bargains will inflate their incidence of success.", "Legal changes should be introduced after carefully considering the social context. If one considers academic research into the working of plea bargains overseas, it would be unwise to extend it to terror-related cases. It is entirely plausible in India to witness a regression in investigation standards as plea bargaining allows prosecutors to browbeat an accused into confession without necessarily having the evidence to see the case through successfully."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

In his view, political energy is finite, and if identity passions waste so much of it, there is very little left over for economic and social uplift. Modi\u2019s idea of a ten-year \u201cmoratorium\u201d on communal wars is very attractive, once again, because it comes from him. There is also some selective amnesia here: a Muzaffarnagar riot-tainted MP is in Modi\u2019s cabinet. Will he be quarantined so that the moratorium can sound real? When things are so close to the bone, even smiling a little can hurt.", "Modi\u2019s tenor and tone make it clear that his foot soldiers are not the only ones responsible for ethnic carnages. He may have cautioned the saffron brigade, but he included all political parties when he made this \u201cmoratorium\u201d appeal. At the same time, Modi disarmed his rivals with his preamble where he paid homage to earlier prime ministers for their contribution to India\u2019s development. This is probably the beginning of a trend for it is going to be difficult for future prime ministers not to start in a similar fashion.", "In the past, Independence Day speeches usually announced big ticket items with a lot of fluff and feathers.

This is probably why Modi\u2019s lightweight policy announcements did not bother us very much.", "He did say that a Sansad Adarsh Grameen Yojana would soon be inaugurated but though it came morally weighted, there was no arithmetic attached. In this scheme, all elected representatives were now supposed to create one model village a year, in their respective constituencies. Likewise, the pumping exhortation that the \u201cMade in India\u201d label should signify world class came with no specifics, just good intentions. Read in it, if you like, an import substitution policy, but it carried neither big words nor numbers.", "Insistence on punctuality today has a strange odour, especially following the Emergency years. Therefore, when Modi pulls up officials who turn up late there is this legacy issue to deal with. Is that fair? Modi argues that it is not and, what is worse, now that bureaucrats have begun to come on time, it has become breaking news. If something so everyday can get so newsy then there must be something rotten in the state of the Republic?", "By the same token something is rotten again, if domesticated homilies \u2014 of hearth and home, of sons and daughters, of cleanliness and toilets \u2014 seem so attractive in an Independence Day speech."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

Their anxiety is understandable because the survey, which ostensibly seeks to identify bogus beneficiaries of government welfare schemes, also carries questions on people\u2019s nativity. If the government chooses to act on answers to such questions, it will violate constitutional provisions which guarantee citizens the right to settle in any part of the country. And if it won\u2019t act on the answers, then why did it ask those questions?", "Fortunately, after an outcry, it now looks as if the survey might drop the nativity questions. But even in that case, a larger question remains about the utility of the survey, for which Telangana will be virtually shut down with no public transport available tomorrow. Moreover, the enumeration of people across 10 districts of Telangana in a single day looks like Mission Impossible. People who miss the survey for whatever reason, fear they will find themselves dispossessed of property and other rights and privileges.", "If the purpose of the survey is merely to identify beneficiaries of welfare schemes, then why is everybody including those from middle and higher income groups being asked to take the survey? The K Chandrasekhar Rao government has only itself to blame for the widespread fear and chaos caused by its survey. He must desist from pursuing a course that victimises people who allegedly cannot trace back their nativity in Telangana. Nor should he invade people\u2019s privacy.

Despite his fighting 82 in the first innings of India\u2019s worst Test defeat in England in 40 years, he has well and truly outlived his usefulness as a captain in the long form of the game. It is not so much the defeat, but the manner of the capitulation that rankles. India\u2019s cricketers have not just been routed in a series they began well, under Dhoni they looked bereft of ideas and direction.", "Statistically, Dhoni still remains India\u2019s most successful Indian Test captain. His win-loss record of 27 Test wins to 17 losses, compares favourably with Saurav Ganguly\u2019s score of 21-13. Yet the fact is that under Dhoni, India have lost 13 and won only 1 of their last 17 overseas Tests. Among Dhoni\u2019s recent contemporaries, only Graeme Smith has lost more Test matches (29), but he also won almost twice as many (53).", "Dhoni has now had six years at the helm, longer than every other Indian captain, with the exception of Pataudi, and is running out of steam.", "Dhoni is right that the team is only as good as its players but he himself is clearly more comfortable with the one-day format. He has always been more at home in the instinctive nature of the T20 or the ODI and he is now also jaded and over-worked.", "As Indian cricket looks inwards, the BCCI should follow the Australian approach of dropping non-performing captains rather than waiting for them to retire. While Dhoni should certainly be relieved of Test captaincy, whether he can continue as ODI captain or not should be decided by his performance in the forthcoming ODI series in England.", "By ", "\nWhat would be the most apt description of the Indian test team? Can\u2019t bat, can\u2019t bowl and most certainly can\u2019t catch. What is the solution? Replace the captain. The likely replacement, Virat Kohli, is perhaps the best among the current generation of Indian batsmen. However, at this moment it may not be an exaggeration to say that he seems unsure of how many stumps are behind him and where they are located when he bats. It might not be the brightest idea to ask him to come up with a winning way before he figures out other problems.", "Around three decades ago, Sunil Gavaskar was accused of being a defensive captain. His succinct reply used to be that his approach reflected the limitations of his team. Think of a bowling attack with Kapil Dev and Dilip Doshi, which is what Gavaskar had at his disposal and think of what the current Indian captain has to play with. The results in England could well have been worse. Dhoni ought not to be replaced as captain in Test cricket because India does not have a replacement handy. Most of India\u2019s top order batsmen had a nightmarish tour, but they are unlikely to be dropped because we lack bench strength. In this situation, replacing Dhoni isn\u2019t going to solve problems.", "Moreover, even on this tour, Dhoni\u2019s captaincy was occasionally praised. When India won unexpectedly at Lord\u2019s, it was Dhoni who convinced Ishant Sharma to bowl short. It produced results. That\u2019s not the sign of a captain sleepwalking. Dhoni is probably on his last legs as a Test player, but this is not the right time to expose anyone else to the burden of leading one of the weakest Test teams.

If the more than 40% of households in the country that are currently outside the banking net can be brought in, the policy can have a transformative impact on the lives of millions.", "Despite successive governments emphasising financial inclusion, the performance of banks in terms of expanding their footprint in rural areas has been lacklustre. But the Jan Dhan Yojana should leverage technology to overcome the lack of physical banking infrastructure. Given the phenomenal growth of mobile phone users in the country, there\u2019s no reason why the mobile banking platform can\u2019t be used to open simple bank accounts. Linking such accounts to Aadhaar numbers would create a viable banking database based on biometric identifiers.", "Mating Aadhaar with the Jan Dhan Yojana creates a powerful tool to reform welfare programmes by switching to direct cash transfers through electronic means. This will curb the enormous leakages that are a hallmark of wasteful and corrupt government welfare programmes such as the PDS while also cutting down the number of intermediaries. If money moves through these accounts it would also give banks the necessary incentive to service them, while building saving habits and financial literacy among the poor. Most importantly, directly putting money in the hands of targeted beneficiaries empowers the latter, freeing them from the yoke of sarkari patronage and babudom. India can thus move from mai baap sarkar to being a modern social democracy, overcoming its colonial legacy.", "In this direction, the Centre could emulate the Rajasthan government which is pioneering the biometrics-tagged Bhamashah card for all female heads of households. That card automatically comes with a bank account which will be used to facilitate insurance, pension and other welfare programmes. Similarly, future Aadhaar beneficiaries could also be given linked bank accounts right from inception.

China\u2019s rising wages are eroding its cost advantage. India can really benefit from this, if it becomes a better place to do business.

The next 20 years are India\u2019s window to move jobs from agriculture to manufacturing, and simultaneously skill up its population for a futuristic landscape.", "Modi\u2019s Independence Day speech also underlined the necessity of skill development at a rapid pace.

It\u2019s not enough for a PM to recognise that India won\u2019t really reap its much-awaited demographic dividend if its youth leave school ill-prepared for a globalised work environment.

Land acquisition and environmental clearance logjams discourage new investments. The GST reform is still gathering dust even though it promises to reduce transaction costs dramatically. But these are not insurmountable challenges.

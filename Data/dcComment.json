The wisdom of generations of Supreme Court judges has been unable to find the ultimate equitable solution that would stop the states of upper riparian Karnataka and lower riparian Tamil Nadu bickering with each other, while Kerala and Puducherry watch with interest as they also have a share in the river\u2019s bounty. In the absence of political will by the chief ministers to meet face to face, the problem keeps recurring. Only nature offers a solution in years of monsoon plenty, when Karnataka can\u2019t hold all the water in its reservoirs and it flows down its snaking west-east course, with the surplus sometimes emptying into the Bay of Bengal off Tamil Nadu\u2019s coast.", "A solution may lie in forming a Cauvery Management Board, like in Bhakra Beas, to take over operations of all Cauvery dams and direct how much water is released downstream even in distress years. There has been no will to countenance the bypassing of political authority and let scientific management take over, acting independently of pulls and pressures. Such a board was ordered to be set up by the tribunal that ruled on the disputes and gave its final award in 2007. Procrastination in setting up an authority led to periodic heartburn along the river\u2019s course, now further complicated by proposals to build new dams, including in Kerala across a tributary of the Cauvery tributary Bhavani named Siruvani, and in Mekedatu in Karnataka. Truth to tell, the finite water resources are insufficient to meet the growing needs of irrigation and city water supply; and more dams will simply mean more problems.", "The 13.6 tmc feet water ordered released over 10 days as interim relief for the samba crop lies in between what Karnataka was prepared to dispense (which is nearer nil in an increasingly water-needy state) and what Tamil Nadu, with a huge delta rice bowl entirely dependent on Cauvery flow, demanded. The historical baggage of an award favouring British-ruled Madras Presidency over the Mysore maharaja\u2019s kingdom has been proving difficult to shake off. Under the 2007 final award, Karnataka is to keep 270 tmc feet while giving 419 tmc feet to Tamil Nadu, besides 30 tmc feet to Kerala and 7 tmc feet to Puducherry. Wouldn\u2019t it be possible in this day and age to disperse water every year going by the same formula, or even a revised one depending on a Supreme Court verdict expected next month, subject, of course, to the actual flows in the river?"], "author": [], "DateTime": ["Sep 8, 2016, 2:56 am IST"]},

This is definitely so for stronger banks, not ones that have been reckless in lending and thrown caution to the winds.

Banks, for instance, need a capital adequacy ratio of nine per cent in order to be able to lend, and if strong banks have to lend, particularly for infrastructure projects, they will have to be strengthened. Besides, it would enable them to clean up their balance sheets, for which they have a deadline that ends next year. All this would enable banks to contribute to growth. Today most banks are risk averse and do not want to lend for fear of\u00a0 increasing their non-performing assets, and this is evident in the weak pick-up in credit growth. There is a view in the government that banks should go in for consolidation through mergers, but they can wait till the cows come home for this to happen as bank chiefs would be reluctant to give up their fiefdoms.

What he means can be clear only to him.", "Iraq, the Chilcot inquiry makes amply clear, posed no security threat to Britain or the US, and had no weapons of mass destruction, as was indicated by the faulty intelligence, which Mr Blair magnified when he spoke of it in public although the basic intelligence inputs were more nuanced.", "After Brexit, Britain is psychologically delinked from Europe.

A defiant fast is a deeply political instrument. Sharmila tried it unsuccessfully, but her individual effort shines. She showed she had no hesitation in courting death by refusing food for long.", "She says she remains steadfast on her cause and voiced the wish to change tack and try another way \u2014 by becoming an independent legislator to promote her cause from inside the precincts of the Manipur Assembly. Sharmila, now 44, also wants to marry. Now that Manipur\u2019s \u201cIron Lady\u201d has decided to end the 16-year-long fast it marks a change in her tactics. But instead of respecting her wishes as an individual, and appreciating the intensity with which the anti-AFSPA battle was fought by her single-handedly, Sharmila\u2019s immediate community in Imphal \u2014 her friends and family \u2014 have shown displeasure with her. The great fighter could not even return to her mother\u2019s home from where she began her incredible journey, presumably for want of welcome.", "Evidently, Sharmila\u2019s erstwhile supporters want her to carry on being a saint in their midst, and refuse to see her in any other way. This is typical of the subcontinent where fasting is a religio-cultural act. It is worth asking if Mahatma Gandhi would have been seen as great if he didn\u2019t have fasting as the principal weapon in his satyagraha armoury. The response of Sharmila\u2019s supporters smacks of hypocrisy. It appears that they would like to have someone else die for their cause even as they lead their lives normally. In an insurgency-wracked state like Manipur, people\u2019s reaction could have also been orchestrated by a section of militants, who appear to have been disappointed with this development. Even in absence of overt threats, it is but natural for people in miltancy hit states like Manipur and Kashmir to toe the line of extremists. Of course, we do not know the truth in this case. But it is apt to state that Sharmila\u2019s status as a fearless warrior for the people\u2019s cause is assured in the annals of history."], "author": [], "DateTime": ["Aug 12, 2016, 12:27 am IST"]},

But there\u2019s no clarity on what the scope of the dialogue will be, but if the Prime Minister is talking of a permanent solution, his mavens must have a broad framework to work with. It remains to be seen if all stakeholders, including Hurriyat hawks, will be brought to the table. Needlessly, the Sunni-dominant Valley is holding India and J&K state hostage with its perfidious approach. Autonomy is a loosely-defined term in Kashmir\u2019s context, its throwback is to Article 370 and the 1952 Delhi Agreement. Pertinently, the State Autonomy Committee set up by Farooq Abdullah\u2019s National Conference in 1996 hits the nail on the head in its 1999 report.", "Undoubtedly, Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s 1953 arrest and a succession of malleable CMs thereafter eroded the construct of the Instrument of Accession and the Delhi Agreement, leaving autonomy in tatters and impinging on the federal context in terms of the contractual relationship. Article 370 itself, the SAC report noted, \u201cacquired a dangerously ambiguous aspect \u2014 designed to protect the state\u2019s autonomy, it has been used systematically to destroy it\u201d. Article 370, enshrined in the Indian Constitution to give Kashmir a \u201cspecial status\u201d, was based on a federal contract. Over time, a dismayed populace of Jammu and Ladakh have sought regional autonomy, but the SAC recommended maximum autonomy in 1999, categorically declaring: \u201cThe best course is for the President of India to repeal all orders which are not in conformity with the Constitution (Application to J&K Order 1950) and the terms of the 1952 Delhi Agreement.\u201d Will this be the basis of the new \u201cpermanent solution\u201d?", "From the apogee of the Nehru-Sheikh Abdullah friendship that delivered J&K to India, the plates of history were soon shifting as the strife in Jammu began to prey on Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s mind. The seeds of the seductive call to chaos were sown by the Delhi Agreement signed on July 24, 1952. Dr Jose Korbel, UNCIP member, in his book Danger in Kashmir, stated: \u201cIt gave to Kashmir special rights which other princely states never had... It was agreed the hereditary ruler would be replaced by a head of state to be elected by the constituent assembly/state assembly for a term of five years; however subject to ratification by the President of India. Second, fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India will apply to J&K subject to the provision that they will not be applicable to the programme of land reforms, including the expropriation of land without compensation, nor they should adversely affect security measures undertaken by the state govt.", "Third, the Kashmir legislature \u2018shall have the power to define and regulate the rights and privileges of the permanent residents of the state, more specially in regard to the acquisition of immovable property, appointments to services and like matters\u2019. Fourth, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India was to be limited, as regards Kashmir, to inter-state disputes, to the fundamental rights applicable to the state and to matters of defence, foreign affairs and communications. The Govt. of India wanted the Supreme Court to be the final court of appeal in civil and criminal cases.\u201d The distance between Nehru and Abdullah was growing by the minute. Jumping into this volatile mix was Mridula Sarabhai. Her July 17, 1953 letter to Sheikh Abdullah, just days before his dramatic August 9 arrest, was revelatory. It was evident Abdullah was no longer in a conciliatory mood and that full autonomy for Kashmir was the only thing he wanted now.", "Though completely independent-minded, Sarabhai was a close associate of Panditji and knew Abdullah very well too. A general secretary of the Congress, she was secretary to Mahatma Gandhi and was well networked in Congress circles. Later, she worked tirelessly for Abdullah\u2019s release. She wrote: \u201cSoon after reaching Delhi, I handed over your letters to Jawaharlalji, Rafi Saheb and Maulana Saheb. To know they carried your feelings \u2018that no useful purpose can be achieved by carrying on oft-talked subjects and hence you had decided not to come to Delhi\u2019 \u2014 really, if I may say so, has come as a shock...\u201d", "\u201cI thought I understood you and wanted to facilitate the way, but I find I was mistaken. In the morning talk, you were good enough to explain to me the basic issues and emphasis. Both Jawaharlalji and you should understand the need of the hour, and only then can a way be found. If the doors are closed between the two of you, what is the way out? I have taken the liberty of conveying my feelings to you and urge you again to reconsider my appeal to you and Jawaharlalji \u2014 that for Kashmir and India \u2014 for humanity and its confidence in both of you \u2014 please understand each other and find a way out. For such a national problem, talk and exchange of views, even though they might be \u2018futile\u2019, can never be useless.\u201d", "It is clear that a rapidly-fraying relationship was sought to be salvaged by Mridula Sarabhai, but all attempts at rapprochement were failing. But some of the salient points of the Delhi Agreement further distilled, that he signed off on but could not later digest. These were:", "\r\nThe decision to abolish the hereditary Dogra dynasty was accepted by New Delhi", "\r\nThe Indian Citizenship Act was made applicable to the state, but the state legislature was empowered to regulate the rights and privileges of permanent residents, specially over acquisition of immovable property and appointment to services", "\r\nThe right of state nationals who had gone to Pakistan or Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 1947 or earlier, to return to their homes was acknowledged", "\r\nThe President of India was empowered to declare a state of emergency in case of external danger, but in case of internal disturbance the power could be exercised only at the request, or the concurrence of, the state government", "\r\nThe President of India was empowered to grant reprieve and commute death sentences", "\r\nIndia agreed confiscation of jagirs without compensation shall permanently stand", "\r\nThe state was allowed its own flag, which was the flag of the National Conference party", "\r\nThe jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was extended to certain matters; and", "\r\nIt was agreed that Jammu and Ladakh should have cultural and regional autonomy", "Greater autonomy versus full integration was what Sheikh Abdullah was grouching about. He argued as accession with India in any form or basis would finally involve the merger of the state with India, alternative solutions of the Kashmir problem must be discussed... He ruled out any accession to Pakistan, and referred to the alternatives of partition, plebiscite-cum-partition, independence of the state guaranteed by India and Pakistan.

Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, who was more a \u201cpeople\u2019s governor\u201d, had preferred to focus on inflation as he felt it was inflation which hurts the poorest most, but those in the government think otherwise, as in their view growth means employment. Though many share this view, that IIP doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a true picture of the economy. The fact that industrial production is the lowest\u00a0in eight months\u00a0is a matter of concern. Today there are several new areas of business in contrast, but still manufacturing matters in a country where 10 million young people enter the job market every year. One wonders if services are growing fast enough to absorb these new entrants. Manufacturing is the sector that provides the maximum jobs. The fall in capital goods production reflects an economy that is not too healthy. One of the explanations for this fall is that investments have not taken off as there is excess capacity.

With the next policy due in October, it is hoped that the government and the RBI will not pussyfoot over this as the committee is yet to be fully constituted, with representatives from both sides.

Six months before the Assembly polls, Mulayam Singh Yadav divested his CM son Akhilesh of the state party chief\u2019s post and gave the latter to his brother Shivpal. This has a bearing on candidates\u2019 selection for the polls, among other matters. The CM, in retaliation, stripped uncle Shivpal, seen as the number two in his government, of all but one (minor) portfolio, signifying a rebellion against his father and uncle. But matters were going off course even earlier.", "On corruption charges, only earlier this week, the CM had dismissed two Cabinet ministers thought to be close to his father. He also suddenly replaced the state chief secretary on Tuesday. The civil servant was considered close to the CM\u2019s uncle, and to Amar Singh, a top political fixer who was expelled by Mulayam Singh from the party but was brought back a few months ago. Will the CM move closer to Azam Khan, a key Muslim leader and Amar Singh\u2019s b\u00eate noir, but a dodgy customer? Is it possible Akhilesh will throw more friendship hints to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi? The CM said last week that if Mr Gandhi visited UP more often, they could be \u201cfriends\u201d. Or will the patriarch Mulayam seek to replace his own son as CM? Akhilesh is credited with some infrastructure building and is said to want to rid the SP of its \u201cpro-criminal\u201d image.

Facilitating the aspirations of the youth will be the real challenge for Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal as well as anyone looking at the whole of the long-neglected Northeast as a vehicle for political ambitions.", "The flush of triumph, enhanced by the BJP show of solidarity in the presence of an array of \u00a0Union ministers and chief ministers in Guwahati, besides Mr Modi making a dash so soon after his return from Tehran, may not last long before demands for real administrative change rise. The BJP, reaching out now to sections other than its Hindi heartland core constituency in its politically ambitious \u201cCongress-mukt Bharat\u201d designs, would also well know that development and job creation cannot remain mere poll promises if it is serious about expanding its presence in the region.\u00a0As for the pan-India political scenario, much as the BJP lays great store by its idea of ousting the Congress everywhere, the Opposition too would be aiming to keep the BJP out in the states going to elections soon. While the battle of basic ideologies has not changed, the public may just have begun to attach more importance to development over politics.

Even if Ishrat Jahan was an LeT agent (although Headley\u2019s indirect statement does not have corroborative value as he had himself \u201cheard\u201d it somewhere), the judicial process supervised by the Gujarat high court deemed the killing of the girl and her three companions a \u201cfake encounter\u201d by the Gujarat police.

Even cynical observers might have been led to think that talks that would continue had begun in some format although it was understood by analysts that the Taliban camp may be riven in factions, with some possibly no longer being in the Pakistani ISI\u2019s thrall.", "Mullah Omar has largely been regarded as a symbolic figure who kept unity intact in the Afghanistan Taliban movement which can be said to be a kindred coalition of extremists of different generations, and possibly also different persuasions \u2014 some less pro-Pakistan than the others.", "His removal from the scene means it is not clear whether Afghanistan under President Ashraf Ghani is actually conducting meaningful dialogue with people who have traditionally gone under the sobriquet of the Taliban, or is being taken for a ride by Islamabad whose principal purpose is to have a controlling influence over Kabul.

It also makes a hard hitting attack on religious charlatans, the so-called mullahs, sadhvis, sants, gurus and mahants who make a living feeding off the insecurities and fear of ordinary people. The film does not attack religion per se. In fact, it pays deep respect to religion in a spiritual sense where the journey is a personal and direct one between the devotee and the Almighty. Its attack is focused on the false intermediaries who obtain much ill-begotten wealth in their ungodly misuse of religion.", "As I left the hall, I asked myself why this film made the cadres of the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad so angry. For days they went on a vandalising streak, breaking public and private property and burning posters of the film. At one level, I understood the real reason for their hysterical anger. Religion is a powerful instrument of control. In its name, people have shed their own blood and that of others. In its name, people have perpetuated the greatest cruelties and acts of discrimination. In its name, riots have taken place and even genocides.", "The Bajrang Dal and the VHP, along with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its other affiliates, believe in using religion to whip up hatred in order to ignite religious divides between people. Their aim is to further religious polarisation for short-term electoral dividends. They arrogate to themselves the pedestal to speak for all Hindus, but not for altruistic reasons. Their goal is to use Hinduism to severe bridges of brotherhood, love and community with those of other faiths. In other words, for them Hinduism is an instrument of control. PK questions the raison d\u2019etre of those who seek to control religion; it questions the basis of self-professed intermediaries; it questions the very need of such middlemen who use religion for their self-interest. It is but natural, therefore, that the Bajrang Dal and VHP are very annoyed by PK\u2019s message.", "But the real problem is also that the protesters are exceptionally ignorant about the phenomenal grandeur of thought of Hinduism. At the philosophical level, Hindu metaphysics sees the Almighty as the omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, indivisible Brahman, which is beyond physical form, and indeed, beyond definition because any definition would circumscribe the absolutism of this attribute-less entity (neti, neti, not this, not this). The powerful Nirguna and Advaita traditions of Hindu philosophy have espoused this unqualified non-duality of godhood for centuries. If the Almighty itself is beyond form and definition, who are these people who claim to speak on its behalf for their own selfish reasons?", "At another level, Hinduism has always sustained within itself a tradition of self-critique, of corrosive honesty and candour which has allowed it to reinvent itself time and again. The most evocative and influential votary of this tradition was Shankaracharya himself, who in the 8th century was responsible for the revival of Hinduism after it had gone into decline as a result of a surfeit of ritual and superstition and the (consequent) appeal of Buddhism. In the Bhaja Govindam, Shankaracharya has this telling shloka: Jatuli mundi, lunchchit keshah, kashayambar bahu krit veshah, pashyanappi na pashyati mudho, hayudar nimitam bahu krit vesha: \u201cMatted locks, shaven head or hair set loose, saffron robes are very deceptive, frauds they are unable to see, fools, they become monks to make a living\u201d. In the Nirvana Shatakam, Shankaracharya again hits out at blind ritualism:", "Na punyam, na paapam, na saukhyam na dukhkham, na mantro na teertham, na vedo na yagna: \u201cNo virtues, no sin, no happiness no sorrow, no mantra, no pilgrimage, no Vedas no sacrifice\u201d. The important point is that Hinduism allows for this critique. Unlike the Semitic religions, Hinduism has no one God, no one text, no one Church and no one Pope. It allows its followers the freedom to dissent while being within the larger tradition of sanatan dharma. That is why Hinduism can include even the Carvaka school which argues that God need not exist, and also accommodate the unorthodox Tantric tradition.", "But even in Islam the Sufi tradition has done a good job of lampooning the superstitions and rituals of the mullahs. Ghalib, who internalised Sufi mysticism best, writes famously: Kahan maikhane ka darwaza Ghalib, aur kahan vaiyaz, Bas itna jaante thhe kal woh jaata tha jab hum nikle: \u201cThe tavern door and the preacher are truly poles apart; All I know is I saw him enter as I left to depart!\u201d What is satire at one plane became the reiteration of a transcendent vision of the absolute at another, and no one could state it so beautifully than Ghalib: Hum muvahid hain, humara kesh hai tark-e-rasoom; millatein jab mit gayeen, azza-e-iman ho gayeen: \u201cGod is one, that is our faith; all rituals we abjure; it is only when the symbols vanish that faith is pure\u201d. This innate suspicion of the orthodox religious establishment was the leitmotif of the powerful Bhakti movement too. Guru Nanak, Kabir, Tuka Ram, Meera \u2014 and many more \u2014 shunned the hypocrisy of organised religion and advocated the ecstasy of a direct communion with the Almighty.", "The vandalising crew of the Bajrang Dal and the VHP, the foot soldiers of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the RSS venting their ire on PK, thus represent the half-literate, lumpen evangelism of those who do not know their own religion and are bent on imposing their limited thinking on the intrinsic grandeur of Hinduism.

This is what has been happening in recent months in several Indian states ruled by the BJP.", "The banning of meat of bullocks and oxen by the Maharashtra and Haryana governments was the first recent intimation of the state pushing a food taboo. The story was sold as the banning of cow slaughter, in an attempt to gain Hindu support. Cow slaughter had already been banned in Haryana since 1955 and Maharashtra since 1976. The bullock and ox are not considered holy by Hindus. The legal justification for the ban is therefore being found in terms of preventing cruelty to animals.", "People in this country eat many other animals too. Goats and chickens are eaten all over India. The Northeast of the country loves its pork and beef. At one time, in some places, dogs were also eaten. In Bihar, there is a community called the Musahars that used to eat rats, and still does. Former chief minister Jitan Ram Majhi is from that community.", "Many such examples can be found. What it shows is that different communities have had different food habits down the centuries. Food is an aspect of culture. I don\u2019t see why the state should side with the culture of one and a half communities in the country, by curtailing the liberties of all others.", "Vegetarianism is a tradition in the Jain community. Hindu Brahmins in several parts of India are also traditionally vegetarians. However, not all Brahmins are vegetarians - Brahmins in Bengal and Kashmir were never vegetarians. All Brahmin communities in Maharashtra and Goa are not vegetarians. Outside the Brahmin caste, most Hindu communities were never vegetarian. Coastal communities have generally been eaters of fish, whether it is in Maharashtra or Tamil Nadu or Orissa. The fish is a part of rituals in Bengali weddings.", "Sacrifice was also a part of worship at the Durga Puja. I have recollections of watching a buffalo being sacrificed at a Durga Puja organized by a Nepali community; perhaps it was the Gorkhas. Goats, of course, were sacrificed in long lines. The sacrificial meat was cooked and eaten as part of the festivities.", "The point is that different communities have different traditions and cultures, and food habits are a part of those traditions and cultures. To impose a variety of minority Brahmin or Jain culture on the other Hindu communities, Dalits, Muslims, Christians, and tribals, is an affront to the vast majority of peoples in this land. It is also an infringement on the fundamental right of people to freedom of culture, and fails to treat all cultures equally. The government has a constitutional duty to protect the rich heritage of our composite culture.", "\u201cSabka saath\u201d is not possible if the government starts to insult the traditions of different Indian communities and to kick people in the stomach in the bargain.", "The moral case for vegetarianism is a strong one (though questions of plant sentience can be asked), but the state is not making that argument.", "It is perfectly fine if the government decides to advise people on the health effects of consuming meat. I wouldn\u2019t mind if statutory health warnings of the sort that come on cigarette packs were posted outside meat shops and on packets of packaged meat.", "However, it is not okay if the government randomly decides, based on prejudice, that some meats should not be eaten. If it\u2019s really about prevention of cruelty to animals, then the slaughter of goats, pigs, buffaloes and chickens should also be banned. So should the killing of rats and dogs. The government itself arranges for the murder of plenty of rats, which are intelligent sentient beings. That should stop, if the principle of preventing cruelty is to be uniformly applied.", "One common side-effect of vegetarian prejudice is the denial of housing to people who eat fish and meat. Northeastern people and Muslims have a particularly hard time finding houses, though Hindus face it too. A law against discrimination in housing is therefore necessary in this very diverse country.", "Until that comes along, I have a suggestion to balance the scales of justice a little bit: Why can\u2019t non vegetarians start treating vegetarians exactly as they themselves are treated? Cruelty to plants is pretty awful too, and the smell of tadka dal (spicy lentils) cooking leaves most people coughing and gasping for breath.

However, the formula of a two-state solution, that was not on the table in the nonalignment days, does offer India a facesaver even when the Hindu right wing dominates the discourse on Israel.", "The Israel-Palestine question apart, it was seen recently that New Delhi rightly showed itself to be on the side of the nuclear deal being worked out between the United States (among major powers) and Iran, an accord that was opposed tooth and nail not just by Israel but also all Arab capitals, particularly Riyadh.

It appears India may now look in parallel at ties beyond the realm of defence cooperation, regardless of how important they are in terms of changing older strategic initiatives, and strike out on an independent path in terms of seeking trade with anyone willing to do business.

He did well in the end, although the BJP was not able to attain what it had set out to do. In J&K, it was not able to barge into the Kashmir Valley electorally. That was its primary aim. Its candidates faced humiliating defeats. In Jharkhand, the saffron party failed to take the state by storm and must rely on a minor ally to clear the halfway mark. The Congress, the BJP\u2019s national rival, has done somewhat better than expected in Jammu, the Valley and in Ladakh \u2014 all the three regions of J&K which are conspicuously distinct from one another.

With the BJP doing extremely well in Jharkhand, regional parties, known for providing faltering coalitions that have been the bane of the state, have been put firmly in the shade.

The National Conference was the incumbent. Way before the election it was evident that it had lost its popularity. Chief minister Omar Abdullah was deemed personally clean and modernistic, but was unable to forge links even with senior leaders of his own party. That has cost him dear.

Scientists are over the moon with the announcement Monday of the discovery of their holy grail, which are gravitational waves in the undulating fabric of the space-time continuum that are echoes of the expansion of the universe beginning an instant after the Big Bang. Much of what is being said now may sound esoteric, but once the findings are sifted, reviewed and accepted as true, then the big question of how our astonishing universe came about 13.8 billion years ago from the fount of a minuscule subatomic particle would be satisfactorily answered. Cosmic inflation is a relatively new concept, spelt out 30 years ago, and scientists believe they have now discovered the missing link of cosmology thanks to a radio telescope at the South Pole and a dedicated team of scientists hunting for the ultimate truth of our existence. What this does to belief in a Creator is anybody\u2019s guess and makes for a trillion-dollar philosophical question.

The aim is noble: ensure savers have a steady income stream till their death. However, the annuities market is still underdeveloped and the returns on offer are not particularly attractive. Subscribers should have more flexibility to reinvest their retirement savings, rather than be forced into buying annuities, even as annuities mature as assets. Such flexibility would be aided by a rational system of taxation of savings.", "Ideally, the exempt-exempt-tax (EET) system that defines the tax treatment of savings at the time of contribution, accumulation and withdrawal, should apply to all savings. All income should be taxed at the applicable rate, except when saved.

That done, the government should refrain from micromanaging what asset the retiree should invest in. The only hurdle to this rational system is the EEE treatment provided to several other savings products. All savings should ideally be under EET.

Three, macroeconomic stability, functional hedging mechanisms and their adoption by economic agents are the best guarantee of avoiding currency shocks. Four, sectoral remedies run the risk of shifting rather than solving a problem. Five, while fears in certain quarters about a secular stagnation across the world might be exaggerated, India should use their negative effect on commodity prices to consolidate its war on inflation and vanquish it.", "While not totally ruling out an interest rate response to economic woes, Rajan\u2019s preference is to kill inflation expectations rather than to prop up growth with negative rates of interest. He points to the quandary of those central bankers whose policy rates are already close to zero and cannot use rate cuts to boost growth to argue that the stimulus to growth has to come from other quarters. Introducing GST, labour reform and removing the obligation on mills to make 40% of the yarn they produce as hanks for use on handlooms are examples of such other boosts that he did not mention.

Power cannot sustain if 30% of its output is not paid for, because of technical loss or theft. Theft is directly a result of political patronage. Loss is a derivative of bad politics: low or nil tariffs preclude investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure. The financial restructuring must have political restructuring as a precondition. The Prime Minister\u2019s vaunted ability to communicate, which he had deployed in Gujarat to sever the power connections of those who failed to pay their bills, must be put to use to drive home the message that good politics lies not in cheap tariffs but in tariffs that cover costs and leave a surplus for investment", "Central government-owned generator NTPC had access to devolutions from the Centre, if state utilities failed to pay for their power purchases.

The solution to both problems is to fix a low, uniform import duty, say, 5 per cent, on all goods and services without exception.

The other is the counter the Nobel committee\u2019s recognition of Deaton\u2019s work offers to the notion that measuring what happens to consumption of particular groups is irrelevant when fast growth improves all lives. Deaton\u2019s body of work argues that programmes like the employment guarantee scheme are needed, even as rapid growth transforms society.", "Macroeconomics studies aggregate demand, savings, investment, income and growth. Aggregate consumption demand stems from consumption of individual goods and services by members of society, whose behaviour is the stuff of microeconomics. Deaton\u2019s refined understanding of how different consumers form their demand for goods and services based on their current needs, incomes and expectations of the future improved the theory of demand, dropping excessively restrictive and unrealistic conditions about consumer behaviour while retaining rationality as a valid attribute. Substituting the simplistic notion of a representative consumer with the combined effect of different classes of consumers whose incomes move in opposite directions, Deaton improved theory and also made it impossible to ignore different implications of policy for different sections of society.", "Thus, Deaton not just freely adulterated high theory with dirty data, but also used insights from the data to improve theory and improve data collection. Some things were not rocket science: he pointed out, for example, how a cereal-dominant price index in India understated poverty when demand had shifted to non-cereals whose prices rose faster than cereal\u2019s.

This is a good idea, but China\u2019s rulers have overlaid a campaign against graft on top of this. Prosecution of some high level officials, and many more at lower levels, has spread fear and stifled investment and conspicuous consumption. One outcome has been capital flight. Yet, this is not the most important cause of China\u2019s slowdown.", "The main reason is massive over-investment in sectors like steel, cement, shipbuilding, petrochemicals and real estate. The property bubble burst in 2014 unravelled all other sectors. A global recession with consequent loss of export markets did not help. Yet, all is not lost. If it persists with its new economic agenda and the CPC decentralises some power, paving the way for institutional reform, China can turn into a much more modern economy. And, with a $10-trillion economy, even 6.9 per cent growth added $690 billion in new value in 2015.", "To see how large that number is, remember, India\u2019s $2-trillion economy would need to grow 34.5 per cent in a single year to add $690 billion in value addition. Of course, such numbers are impossible to achieve, but India\u2019s economy as well as our troubles are very different from China\u2019s. Our exposure to global markets is much lower, overcapacity is not a menace, and our slowdown is largely due to domestic factors. Lower energy prices will help both nations. But New Delhi and state governments must use every policy tool in their kit to pull the economy up by its bootstrap. That calls for political courage, not luck."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

The Mid-Year Review estimates the additional boost the economy has received is 1-1.5% percentage points of GDP. Looking ahead, the upside on this score is likely to be limited even with continued softness in oil prices. Private consumption, after all, can shore up the economic momentum only so much and no further. Also, weaker oil and commodity prices would mean lower realisations, margins and prices across the economy. Besides, much easier oil prices would affect revenues of oil producers and likely put further pressure on our export growth. The review, though, seems more sanguine on exports. Sure, in statistical terms, exports may start to look up after declining for an entire year. But a weak global economy is unlikely to rev up export demand soon.", "Private corporate investment in India also appears to be falling (as a percentage of GDP).

This goes against the grain of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, which says the government has to conduct its fiscal operations transparently.

What India also needs is credible macro economic data in public domain.", "Collating data on tax collection according to the income bracket and the number of people within each bracket is not rocket science. The government, as Piketty pointed out, published All India Income Tax Statistics until 2000. It also did away with commodity-wise data on tax collections. The government should restore this. The name and permanent account number of the taxpayer should remain anonymous to ensure there is no breach of confidentiality. This is eminently feasible, given that 95 per cent of both direct and indirect tax returns are filed online now. India has the software prowess for such data collation. This will help our researchers too. The Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Board of Customs and Excise should put out the data on their websites.", "Piketty said he favours high taxes for the wealthy. High tax rates, however, will discourage work and investment in India. Moreover, additionally burdening honest taxpayers is unjust and won\u2019t make more of them comply.

A drought, a flood or a blight can wither crops and send food prices shooting up, in our economy with its poor storage and food processing facilities.

We do need to quickly strike gas deals with gas-rich Iran, and not just for LNG imports and possibly piped offshore supply, but also as feedstock for Indian fertiliser plants that can come up there as international sanctions are finally lifted in that country.

If the road grid of a city were, for example, to resemble a honeycomb, meaning devoid of major trunk roads, traffic is unlikely ever to come to a complete halt, as would happen when a trunk road is blocked. It is imperative to design the roads for public transport and to treat parking as a luxury. Construction of roads matters, too. Typically, contracts do not fortify the maximum time stipulation with stiff penalties. Contracts are awarded on financial parameters alone, without factoring in the pollution dimension of traffic-choking during the construction period.", "How often lights change at traffic signals is often overlooked.

No access provider should be able to block a site or throttle or accelerate access to it for payment. An internet access provider operates a platform business with markets on two sides, one facing consumers and the other facing content providers. It is tempting for access providers to offer content providers different business deals on how easily consumers can access their sites, depending on how much they pay. However, if this market is activated, those with money power would be able to ward off new competition by paying their way to privileged access and blocking or severely degrading the access of new or potential competitors. This would kill the huge creative potential of the internet to create new businesses, jobs and incomes.", "Hence the need for net neutrality, which essentially means that internet access providers must make all their money from consumers and none from content providers. Offering virtual private networks for enterprises is a legitimate business for telcos. Net neutrality should not interfere with it. This, Trai should clarify, is the only legitimate purpose of the exemption for closed networks provided for in its order."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

In other words, this preliminary reform should lead on to radical reform of fertiliser pricing, something that reformers have not had stomach for. The arrangement thus far has been that different urea units pay different prices for gas, which is now the main feedstock for most of the domestic plants numbering 30. An equable price would lower working capital requirement and subsidy receivable and, more important, urea producers would be incentivised to rev up efficiency improvement, boost capacity utilisation \u2014 over and above rated capacity \u2014 and increase turnover. The fact of the matter is that while domestic urea output adds up to about 23 million tonnes (MT), demand is put at 30 MT and rising. Demand is exaggerated, as farmers cut down on decontrolled phosphatic and potassic fertilisers and use urea instead. Plus, urea stocks are hoarded to push up prices in the black market.", "Urea overuse affects soil health and fertility and is plain misallocation of resources. The way ahead is to decontrol the price of urea and bring it under the nutrient-based subsidy regime. In parallel, we need to expedite upfront direct payment of fertiliser subsidy to small and medium farmers; and revise prices and productivity to allow higher input costs to be absorbed by farmers without stress. The larger issue is to better allocate resources for investment, including irrigation, agricultural extension services and better knowledge for key inputs like seeds. The decision to allow urea producers to coat urea granules with neem extract is also innovative: it would prolong nitrogen release to the soil and reduce usage.

The religious zealotry that terrorists use to gather recruits and legitimise their depredations derives from the conceptualisation of Pakistan as an Islamic state necessarily hostile to India.

All were areas where Muslim rule was tenuous, or non-existent. The north Indian heartland, where Islamic rule was concentrated, had the fewest number of Muslims. The best explanation for this, he suggests, is exposure to trade and commerce with the larger Islamic world: for Bengal and the coastal areas via maritime routes; for Punjab and the northwest, via connections overland to Central Asia and beyond.

He presented a cogent economic philosophy, radiated the confidence that he would be able to execute the strategy flowing from this vision and called upon everyone, particularly businessmen and entrepreneurs, to join a mass movement of development that would embrace everyone and enrich everyone, while the government provides succour to empower the poor and the vulnerable. Most notably, he called for social peace and cohesion, calling them prerequisites of growth, almost as if responding to his critics on this score.", "Modi\u2019s invocation of a $20-trillion Indian economy might sound like ambition gone berserk: the figure is 25 per cent bigger than the world\u2019s biggest economy today, while the Indian economy is less than $2 trillion. But consider: a real growth of 9 per cent, which India had reached comfortably before the crisis, along with inflation of 5 per cent, means a 14 per cent rate of nominal growth. At that pace, the economy would double in five years, quadruple in 10, be eight times as large in 15, and be more than 10 times as large in less than 18 years. At high income levels, economies tend to slow down, but India\u2019s demographic dividend would sustain for two decades more and productivity gains would more than offset inflation differentials with the US. A $20-trillion economy is, thus, quite a reasonable target. But no leader has till now shown the gumption to articulate such vaulting reasonableness, to fire the ambition of the country\u2019s youth.", "Modi elaborated, for the first time, what precisely he means by minimum government, maximum governance. The government has no business to be in business, he said, but should do five things: provide public goods, manage externalities \u2014 whether negative ones like pollution or positive ones such as the productivity gains from mass education and skilling \u2014 control market power of companies, fill information gaps and provide welfare to those on the margins. Technology would enable the government to be competent, non-corrupt and efficient. Digital India would also advance education, healthcare and financial inclusion.", "The objective of reform is welfare. Some reform would be driven from the top, others from below, through popular adoption of innovation. Both are important. The state can incentivise an additional 20,000 MW of generation capacity, but an equal impact can be made by people willingly saving power. Cleaning the Ganga, Swachh Bharat and a vibrant tourism industry are campaigns that feed into one another, and can succeed only with mass participation that lives out the principle that Small is Beautiful. The state has to abandon its mindset of command and control and empower the people.", "Talk is cheap, and walking the talk is the tough part. It is indeed welcome that PM Modi has committed himself to nurturing education and healthcare, uplift of the downtrodden and social cohesion. This would address concerns that his big business orientation would hurt social development and welfare. Most vitally, identifying social peace as a precondition for prosperity offers a foil to the spirit of schism embodied in the words and deeds of the larger Sangh Parivar on whose shoulders Modi rode to Raisina Hill. They have to heed the PM\u2019s call for social cohesion, if India is to attain its potential as an economy and civilisation. The point is to uphold, not vitiate, India\u2019s tradition of unity in diversity."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

Other fertilisers, phosphatic and potassic, whose prices had been decontrolled earlier, have seen prices triple or more, and demand plummet. The results of this excessive use of urea are many, none palatable. One, since the urea subsidy is paid out on a cost-plus basis directly to producers, there is every disincentive to not discipline costs: factory prices of urea vary from as low as Rs 11,000 per tonne to Rs 44,000 per tonne. Second, excessive use of urea erodes soil fertility over the long term.", "Third, there are leakages in distribution: though the mandated selling price is set at a little over Rs 260 for a 50-kg bag, farmers in north India complain that there is no standardised price set in so-called fair-price shops, where the cost of a bag can shoot up to Rs 400-600 per bag. This black marketing of urea was one of the major reasons behind Mayawati\u2019s defeat in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls of 2012. Even after these leakages, urea continues to be the cheapest fertiliser available in India, because most potassic and phosphatic fertilisers are imported and their prices set by global energy rates.", "If India has to eliminate fertiliser sops, it has to take some drastic measures. Urea must be decontrolled and a competitive market opened up in its production and distribution. Some Indian companies might find it more profitable to set up plants in gas-rich West Asia. Subsidies, if any, must be delivered directly as cash transfers to farmers. Finally, India\u2019s energy policy and taxes must allow more gas and naphtha to flow to local producers than they do at present."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

By the end of the SEZ gold rush, 388 of these had been notified by the government. But gradually, many of these SEZs became simply real estate plays, surrendering tax and export rights, simply to retain the land acquired cheap. Unsurprisingly, less than 48 per cent of the notified SEZs today actually do any export activity. Apart from Punjab, Chandigarh and Chhattisgarh, no state fulfils 100 per cent of its export obligations. SEZs in most of the Union territories and northeastern states export nothing from SEZs. On the other hand, Tamil Nadu, which applied for and got relatively fewer SEZs, is one of our largest exporters. SEZ export growth has also slumped, from a peak of 101 per cent in 2009-10 from the previous fiscal, to a measly 3.8 per cent in 2013-14.", "Clearly, the idea of grafting a Chinese success story on the Indian economy has failed; resources have been misdirected and revenues lost.

In the absence of such agreements, companies that deploy employees abroad agree to pick up their social-security-tax bill. As the compensation attracts tax, they also pay the extra income tax. It jacks up the overall cost of deploying workers abroad and creates a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0vis rivals from countries with which the host country has a totalisation agreement.

Local bodies are also supposed to ensure safe waste handling and set up collection centres as well as direct plastic manufactures to set up such centres in line with the principle of extended producers\u2019 responsibility. Nothing could be enforced, in practice.", "So, the challenge really is to enforce rules and improve municipal waste management systems.

First, the gunning down by the Andhra Pradesh police of at least 20 woodcutters working for red sander smugglers. The police claim that, when confronted, the labourers attacked using their basic tools and stones. Take into account reports that many of the dead were shot in the face or the head, and some had burn marks inconsistent with bullet injuries, and it seems the intent was to kill, not arrest or disperse.", "Then, in Telangana, the police claim five Simi suspects tried to escape \u2014 while being escorted by around 17 policemen \u2014 and were shot dead, while yet handcuffed. The pictures of this \u2018encounter\u2019, and the statements of relatives of the killed and their lawyers \u2014 who aver the accused were likely to be freed \u2014 suggest yet another custodial killing. The highest court in the land has called such killings the foulest of all; but they continue. The National Human Rights Commission has asked the Andhra administration for an explanation on the woodcutters\u2019 killing. But what needs to be done, speedily, is a thorough probe into both incidents. Even if the Simi suspects were terrorists, custodians of the law engaging in fake encounters unravels the law itself, makes the state implicit in acts of terror. Meanwhile, a judicial commission report on the gang rape and killing of a tribal girl \u2014 dubbed a Maoist by the Chhattisgarh police \u2014 refutes the police version and confirms this was a fake encounter. This, after four years.", "So, first we have such killings, then, if lucky, a probe, which years later might find some of the truth. This is worthy of a third-rate banana republic. We need quick probes, swift judgments and the harshest punishment for killers in uniform. Perversion of the law by its custodians perverts the whole polity.

Clearly, the harassment, penalisation and exploitation of sex workers needs to be tackled, and so we do need a holistic debate on the issue. Legally speaking, the difference between legalisation and decriminalisation is a matter of degrees; a matter of the official restrictions and laws that govern the sex trade. Legalisation would mean there are specific laws dealing with the trade, decriminalisation would broadly mean that while there are no specific laws imposed, the sex industry is regulated via extant, ordinary statutes. Given social realities in India, there could be a case more for decriminalisation, which can help tackle exploitation and trafficking, and improve the safety and working conditions of the women involved. In a decriminalised regime, for example, laws that criminalise prostitution are removed, while a distinction is maintained between voluntary sex trade and that involving trafficking, coercion and under-age prostitution \u2014 which remain as criminal activities.

This is not just a major step forward to decongest India\u2019s overcrowded jails, but also a variety of judicial reform a country with strong democratic ideals needs.

And a system where people serve years in jails for petty offences, or because the trial drags interminably on, constitutes a travesty of justice. That the government already had similar plans for freeing under-trials underscores there is a commonality of views on this aspect of judicial reform. This convergence should, ideally , broaden, so that our creaky , if not downright dysfunctional, justice system is on par with the leading democracies of the world.", "An estimated two-thirds of around four lakh prisoners in our jails are those awaiting trial, with many already having spent years in gaol.

So, improving the standards of the lower judiciary is another aspect of those reforms, just as ensuring -at another end of the spectrum -that the law enforcement agencies are unbiased: an issue raised by the fact that a disproportionate percentage of under-trials in our jails are from the minority community . Such a holistic vision is central to develop a truly unbiased, efficient and time-bound justice system."], "TypographyTag": [], "author": []},

But now, the 1700-2000 MHz spectrum block is chopped up into slices for sharing between various defence and commercial interests.

Without enough spectrum, these auctions can kill the industry and damage banks that have lent to licensees crippled in the auction process. Telecom regulator Trai has, in its latest recommendation, stressed the importance of political leadership being brought to bear to avert the crisis that would cripple India\u2019s telecom revolution if auctions are held without enough spectrum being made available.
